The High Command had just put down a coup attempt from the self-proclaimed Crown Prince Raschallion, and a crack down on any form of dissent against the new government was underway. These political and social outcasts, known as the Gray Order, sought to leave their neighbors in peace as they pursued dark arcane knowledge. The leaders of this outcast society were a married couple: Gregori Hastur, the Gray Warlock, and his wife Amoline, the Shadow Witch. Together they led an exodus of magicians and other intelligentsia from Noxus, resettling their followers beyond the Great Barrier to the northern reaches of the unforgiving Voodoo Lands. Though survival was a challenge at times, the Gray Order's colony managed to thrive in a land where so many others would have failed.\n\nYears after the exodus, Gregori and Amoline had a child: Annie. Early on, Annie's parents knew there was something special about their daughter. At the age of two, Annie miraculously ensorcelled a shadow bear - a ferocious denizen of the petrified forests outside the colony - turning it into her pet. To this day she keeps her bear \"Tibbers\" by her side, often keeping him spellbound as a stuffed doll to be carried like a child's toy. The combination of Annie's lineage and the dark magic of her birthplace have given this little girl tremendous arcane power. It is this same girl who now finds herself as one of the most sought-after champions within the League of Legends - even by the city-state that would have exiled her parents had they not fled beforehand."},"title":"the Dark Child","icon":"Annie_Square_0.png","select_sound":"en_US/Annie.mp3","id":1},"2":{"skins":{"0":{"portrait":"Olaf_0.jpg","internal_name":"BaseOlaf","name":"","base":true,"splash":"Olaf_Splash_0.jpg","id":2000},"1":{"portrait":"Olaf_1.jpg","internal_name":"ValhallanOlaf","name":"Forsaken Olaf","base":false,"splash":"Olaf_Splash_1.jpg","id":2001},"2":{"portrait":"Olaf_2.jpg","internal_name":"NiflheimOlaf","name":"Glacial Olaf","base":false,"splash":"Olaf_Splash_2.jpg","id":2002},"3":{"portrait":"Olaf_3.jpg","internal_name":"BroOlaf","name":"Brolaf","base":false,"splash":"Olaf_Splash_3.jpg","id":2003},"4":{"portrait":"Olaf_4.jpg","internal_name":"PentakillOlaf","name":"Pentakill Olaf","base":false,"splash":"Olaf_Splash_4.jpg","id":2004},"count":5},"rating":{"magic":3,"defense":5,"attack":9,"difficulty":4},"tags":{"fighter":true,"melee":true},"internal_name":"Olaf","name":"Olaf","abilities":[{"cost":[55.0,60.0,65.0,70.0,75.0],"desc":"Olaf throws an axe into the ground at a target location, dealing damage to units it passes through and slowing their movement speed.

This fearsome evolution is a product of their unforgiving home, Lokfar - a barren tundra where all creatures must vie bitterly for every resource.  Olaf belonged to a seafaring clan known for ruthlessly pillaging any and all villages within reach of their dragon-crested longboats.  The last time he saw his icy home, Olaf was embarking on an expedition to pioneer and plunder a distant land known only to legend.

This unfamiliar place stunned and frightened the Berserker, for Lokfar is not privy to such potent magicians.  Approaching them, Olaf hoped that they could use their mysterious powers to send him back to his people.  A bargain was struck.  Olaf would use his awesome prowess as a warrior to serve the unusual wars of Valoran in the League of Legends, and in exchange the sorcerers would find him a way to return.  Despite his participation in the League, Olaf knows better than to trust the \"finger wagglers\" that run the Institute of War.  He deliberately keeps details of his life and home from them.  After all, with enough information, they would most certainly find the Lokfarians and dominate them as they have dominated all of Valoran, keeping both quietly -- and unwittingly -- in their thrall.\n\nBeware the war cry of the Berserker.

Peerless at crafting sentient beings, Durand's constructs served as tireless guardians for the border towns of his beloved city-state, affording them protection from their Noxian neighbors.

When Twisted Fate learned of an experiment being conducted in Zaun that might help him with his wish, he did the only thing a gambler of his worth could do - he went all in and volunteered for the experiment.\n\nConducted by the infamous Dr. Xavier Rath, Twisted Fate was told that the wager for such participation might be steep.  He might change forever, or nothing might happen, or he might die horribly.  Pain, however, was likely a part of the deal no matter the outcome. These were hardly the worst odds the gambler had faced; his hopes raised, Twisted Fate underwent the experiment, enduring what he must for a chance at his dream.  Then, it ended - with seemingly no effect whatsoever.  The gypsy rogue flew into a murderous rage, but, before he could strike down the team, he suddenly teleported himself miles away.  With a sly grin, he realized his luck had won out yet again. He now brings his luck and rakish charm to the Institute of War, where he is the Champion of choice for many - especially the gambling kind.  To this day, Twisted Fate has avoided his inevitable reunion with Dr. Rath.  The Card Master knows, however, that a confrontation is coming.\n\nWhile the future may be mysterious and unknown to most, Twisted Fate is certain that his future lies within the cards."},"title":"the Card Master","icon":"TwistedFate_Square_0.png","select_sound":"en_US/TwistedFate.mp3","id":4},"5":{"skins":{"0":{"portrait":"XinZhao_0.jpg","internal_name":"BaseXinZhao","name":"","base":true,"splash":"XinZhao_Splash_0.jpg","id":5000},"1":{"portrait":"XinZhao_1.jpg","internal_name":"CommandoXenZhao","name":"Commando Xin Zhao","base":false,"splash":"XinZhao_Splash_1.jpg","id":5001},"2":{"portrait":"XinZhao_2.jpg","internal_name":"ImperialXenZhao","name":"Imperial Xin Zhao","base":false,"splash":"XinZhao_Splash_2.jpg","id":5002},"3":{"portrait":"XinZhao_3.jpg","internal_name":"GladiatorXenZhao","name":"Viscero Xin Zhao","base":false,"splash":"XinZhao_Splash_3.jpg","id":5003},"4":{"portrait":"XinZhao_4.jpg","internal_name":"WingedHussarXenZhao","name":"Winged Hussar Xin Zhao","base":false,"splash":"XinZhao_Splash_4.jpg","id":5004},"5":{"portrait":"XinZhao_5.jpg","internal_name":"ZhaoYunXinZhao","name":"Warring Kingdoms Xin Zhao","base":false,"splash":"XinZhao_Splash_5.jpg","id":5005},"count":6},"rating":{"magic":3,"defense":6,"attack":8,"difficulty":3},"tags":{"fighter":true,"melee":true,"assassin":true},"internal_name":"XinZhao","name":"Xin Zhao","abilities":[{"cost":[30.0,30.0,30.0,30.0,30.0],"desc":"Xin Zhao's next 3 standard attacks deal increased damage that reduce his other ability cooldowns, with the third attack knocking an opponent into the air.","cooldown":[9.0,8.0,7.0,6.0,5.0],"tooltip_values":{"@Effect1Amount@":[15.0,30.0,45.0,60.0,75.0],"@CharAbilityPower@":0.59999999999999998},"tooltip":"Xin Zhao's next 3 basic attacks deal @Effect1Amount@ (+@f1@) bonus physical damage and reduce his other abilities' cooldowns by 1 second.

This meant eventual death for every contender, but with unparalleled glory. Xin Zhao, known then as Viscero, was slated to face 300 soldiers, nearly six times the previous record. This was clearly meant to be his final match. Jarvan II, hearing of this unprecedented feat, infiltrated the arena to offer him an alternative: serve Demacia and punish those who ultimately sentence him to death in exchange for his freedom. Xin Zhao accepted, astonished that a king would risk his own life on his behalf. Under the cover of a prearranged Demacian assault on Noxus, Jarvan liberated Xin Zhao and his 300 opponents. During their retreat, Xin Zhao took a poisoned dart meant for Jarvan. This act of loyalty, from a man who vowed no allegiance, earned Xin Zhao a spot at his side until the day the king died.

When his body was unable to weather further abuse, the crippled Urgot was delegated the position of High Executioner of Noxus.  By this time, his hands had been ruined and he could barely walk.  Scythe-like grafts affixed to his maimed limbs served to carry out his bloody work.\n\nUrgot finally met his end at what should have been his finest hour.  Because of his military background, he often accompanied detachments into foreign territory to carry out judgment.  After ambushing an enemy force, Jarvan IV, Crown Prince of Demacia, fell into the clutches of Urgot's division.  Too far from Noxus to risk transporting their prize for ransom, Urgot prepared to dispose of their captive.  At the final moment, however, the Dauntless Vanguard, led by Garen, the Might of Demacia, intervened, and Urgot was cut in two by the zealous warrior as he scrambled to free his Prince.

Inside he found an aging monk who appraised him with eyes of pure crimson.  Vladimir surprised the monk by returning the wicked gaze with zeal.  Recognizing the boy's sinister craving, the monk taught Vladimir how to manipulate and control the fluid of life, often practicing on passing travelers.  When it came time for Vladimir to learn the final lesson, the monk warned that failure would result in death.  Vladimir did not fail, but success bore a grisly surprise.  During the ritual, every drop of the monk's blood was drawn from his body and fused with Vladimir's, imbuing him with his master's magical essence, and that of every hemomancer before him.  Left alone and suddenly without purpose, Vladimir resolved to return to Noxus, demanding enrollment in the League to prove the supremacy of his craft.  When the Noxian High Command observed the gruesome fates which befell the palace guards, they elected to avail themselves of Vladimir's unsavory talents."},"title":"the Crimson Reaper","icon":"Vladimir_Square_0.png","select_sound":"en_US/Vladimir.mp3","id":8},"9":{"skins":{"0":{"portrait":"FiddleSticks_0.jpg","internal_name":"BaseFiddleSticks","name":"","base":true,"splash":"FiddleSticks_Splash_0.jpg","id":9000},"1":{"portrait":"FiddleSticks_1.jpg","internal_name":"GhostFiddlesticks","name":"Spectral Fiddlesticks","base":false,"splash":"FiddleSticks_Splash_1.jpg","id":9001},"2":{"portrait":"FiddleSticks_2.jpg","internal_name":"UnionJackFiddlesticks","name":"Union Jack Fiddlesticks","base":false,"splash":"FiddleSticks_Splash_2.jpg","id":9002},"3":{"portrait":"FiddleSticks_3.jpg","internal_name":"BanditoFiddlesticks","name":"Bandito Fiddlesticks","base":false,"splash":"FiddleSticks_Splash_3.jpg","id":9003},"4":{"portrait":"FiddleSticks_4.jpg","internal_name":"PumpkinHeadFiddlesticks","name":"Pumpkinhead Fiddlesticks","base":false,"splash":"FiddleSticks_Splash_4.jpg","id":9004},"5":{"portrait":"FiddleSticks_5.jpg","internal_name":"PirateFiddlesticks","name":"Fiddle Me Timbers","base":false,"splash":"FiddleSticks_Splash_5.jpg","id":9005},"6":{"portrait":"FiddleSticks_6.jpg","internal_name":"SurprisePartyFiddlesticks","name":"Surprise Party Fiddlesticks","base":false,"splash":"FiddleSticks_Splash_6.jpg","id":9006},"7":{"portrait":"FiddleSticks_7.jpg","internal_name":"CandyCaneFiddlesticks","name":"Dark Candy Fiddlesticks","base":false,"splash":"FiddleSticks_Splash_7.jpg","id":9007},"count":8},"rating":{"magic":9,"defense":3,"attack":2,"difficulty":5},"tags":{"mage":true,"jungler":true,"ranged":true},"internal_name":"FiddleSticks","name":"Fiddlesticks","abilities":[{"cost":[65.0,75.0,85.0,95.0,105.0],"desc":"Strikes a target unit with fear, causing it to flee in terror for a duration.","cooldown":[15,14,13,12,11],"tooltip_values":{"@CharAbilityPower@":1.0,"@Effect2Amount@":[0,1.5,2,2.5,3]},"tooltip":"Strikes a target enemy unit with fear, causing it to flee in terror for @Effect2Amount@ second(s).","name":"Terrify"},{"cost":[80.0,90.0,100.0,110.0,120.0],"desc":"Fiddlesticks saps the life force of an enemy, dealing damage to a target over time and healing himself.","cooldown":[10.0,9.0,8.0,7.0,6.0],"tooltip_values":{"@Effect1Amount@":[60.0,90.0,120.0,150.0,180.0],"@CharAbilityPower@":0.44999998807907104,"@Effect3Amount@":[60.0,65.0,70.0,75.0,80.0]},"tooltip":"Deals @Effect1Amount@ (+@CharAbilityPower@) magic damage each second to target unit and heals Fiddlesticks for @Effect3Amount@% of the damage dealt. \nLasts up to 5 seconds.","name":"Drain"},{"cost":[50.0,70.0,90.0,110.0,130.0],"desc":"A wisp of wind strikes an enemy unit and then bounces to nearby enemy units, dealing damage and silencing the victims.","cooldown":[15.0,14.0,13.0,12.0,11.0],"tooltip_values":{"@Effect1Amount@":[5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0],"@CharAbilityPower@":0.44999998807907104,"@Effect3Amount@":[65.0,85.0,105.0,125.0,145.0]},"tooltip":"Strikes an enemy target and then bounces to a nearby enemy unit.

Only the burning emerald light of his unearthly gaze pierces the musty darkness of his dust-covered home.  It is here that the Harbinger of Doom keeps a silent vigil.  His is a cautionary tale of power run amok, taught to all summoners within the League.  Decades ago, there existed a powerful rune mage from Zaun - Istvaan.  At the end of the fifth Rune War, he became one of the League's first summoners.  Too much a prisoner to the old ways of magic, Istvaan stepped further and further outside the rules of conduct in the League.  In what was ultimately his last match, his reach finally exceeded his grasp.  Sealing himself inside the easternmost summoning chamber, he began incanting the most forbidden of rituals - an extra-planar summoning.\n\nWhat exactly happened inside that chamber remains unknown.  No champion came to represent Zaun that day in Summoner's Rift.  Only silence echoed back from repeated knocks on the chamber door.  The first apprentice who entered was cut down immediately by an unearthly scythe.  What few who followed and survived were driven mad by fear, mere husks of men gibbering about crows and death.  Afraid of the evil even Istvaan could not control, the League sealed all exits to the chamber, hoping they could contain what they could not destroy.  Years went by, but the wooden figure within never moved save to slay any foolish enough to enter.  Seeing no recourse to reclaim the chamber, the Council instead devised a use for Fiddlesticks: executioner.  While he comes to life and seemingly abides by the rules of summoning in the Fields of Justice, what he awaits inside his chamber is unknown.  His unmoving face yields no clues, and his scythe stands ready to strike down any who stand before him.\n\nThose who say 'you have nothing to fear but fear itself' have not yet felt the crows."},"title":"the Harbinger of Doom","icon":"FiddleSticks_Square_0.png","select_sound":"en_US/FiddleSticks.mp3","id":9},"10":{"skins":{"0":{"portrait":"Kayle_0.jpg","internal_name":"BaseKayle","name":"","base":true,"splash":"Kayle_Splash_0.jpg","id":10000},"1":{"portrait":"Kayle_1.jpg","internal_name":"SilverJudicator","name":"Silver Kayle","base":false,"splash":"Kayle_Splash_1.jpg","id":10001},"2":{"portrait":"Kayle_2.jpg","internal_name":"ViridianJudicator","name":"Viridian Kayle","base":false,"splash":"Kayle_Splash_2.jpg","id":10002},"3":{"portrait":"Kayle_3.jpg","internal_name":"UnmaskedJudicator","name":"Unmasked Kayle","base":false,"splash":"Kayle_Splash_3.jpg","id":10003},"4":{"portrait":"Kayle_4.jpg","internal_name":"GunMetalJudicator","name":"Battleborn Kayle","base":false,"splash":"Kayle_Splash_4.jpg","id":10004},"5":{"portrait":"Kayle_5.jpg","internal_name":"JudgementJudicator","name":"Judgment Kayle","base":false,"splash":"Kayle_Splash_5.jpg","id":10005},"6":{"portrait":"Kayle_6.jpg","internal_name":"MetalWingedJudicator","name":"Aether Wing Kayle","base":false,"splash":"Kayle_Splash_6.jpg","id":10006},"count":7},"rating":{"magic":6,"defense":9,"attack":5,"difficulty":3},"tags":{"fighter":true,"support":true},"internal_name":"Kayle","name":"Kayle","abilities":[{"cost":[70.0,75.0,80.0,85.0,90.0],"desc":"Blasts an enemy unit with angelic force, dealing damage, slowing Movement Speed, and applying Holy Fervor.","cooldown":[8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0],"tooltip_values":{"@Effect1Amount@":[60.0,110.0,160.0,210.0,260.0],"@CharAbilityPower@":1.0,"@Effect2Amount@":[35.0,40.0,45.0,50.0,55.0],"@Effect3Amount@":[3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0]},"tooltip":"Blasts a target, dealing @Effect1Amount@ (+@f2@) (+@CharAbilityPower@) magic damage, slowing their Movement Speed by @Effect2Amount@% for @Effect3Amount@ seconds, and applying a stack of Holy Fervor.","name":"Reckoning"},{"cost":[60.0,70.0,80.0,90.0,100.0],"desc":"Blesses a target friendly champion, granting them increased movement speed and healing them.","cooldown":[15.0,15.0,15.0,15.0,15.0],"tooltip_values":{"@Effect1Amount@":[60.0,105.0,150.0,195.0,240.0],"@CharAbilityPower@":0.34999999403953552,"@Effect2Amount@":[18.0,21.0,24.0,27.0,30.0],"@Effect3Amount@":[3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0]},"tooltip":"Blesses an allied champion, increasing their Movement Speed by @Effect2Amount@% for @Effect3Amount@ seconds and healing them for @Effect1Amount@ (+@CharAbilityPower@) health.","name":"Divine Blessing"},{"cost":[45.0,45.0,45.0,45.0,45.0],"desc":"Ignites Kayle's sword with a holy flame, granting Kayle a ranged splash attack and bonus magic damage.","cooldown":[16.0,16.0,16.0,16.0,16.0],"tooltip_values":{"@Effect1Amount@":[20.0,30.0,40.0,50.0,60.0],"@CharAbilityPower@":0.40000000000000002,"@Effect2Amount@":[20.0,25.0,30.0,35.0,40.0]},"tooltip":"Kayle increases her Attack Range by 400 for 10 seconds and her basic attack deals an additional @Effect1Amount@ (+@CharAbilityPower@) magic damage on hit.\n\nIn addition, enemies near her target take @Effect2Amount@% of her Attack Damage plus @Effect1Amount@ (+@CharAbilityPower@) magic damage on attack.","name":"Righteous Fury"},{"cost":[100.0,75.0,50.0],"desc":"Shields Kayle or an ally for a short time, causing them to be immune to damage.","cooldown":[90.0,75.0,60.0],"tooltip_values":{"@Effect1Amount@":[2.0,2.5,3.0],"@CharAbilityPower@":1.0},"tooltip":"Bathes Kayle's target in a holy light, rendering them immune to all damage for @Effect1Amount@ seconds.","name":"Intervention"}],"tips":{"as":["Using Intervention on a high-DPS ally can turn the tides of battle by giving your ally free reign to attack.

When Alistar returned, he found his village burning and his family slain. Bellowing with rage, he charged an entire regiment of Noxus' elite, slaughtering them by the hundreds.

Suddenly free, Alistar joined the newly formed League of Legends to fight as a champion, hoping to one day exact his final vengeance upon Noxus and find the girl who had renewed his hope. Initially unwilling to cater to his celebrity status as a champion, Alistar has since discovered that there is power in fame, and he has become a vocal advocate for those whom the Noxian government treads upon. He also calls to light things that the Noxian military would prefer remain hidden -- something that has made him very unpopular with Noxus' nobles.

For most, pursuit of such knowledge is formalized in a college or university. The halls of traditional study were never for Ryze, however, who felt a more raw and primal connection to the magic of Runeterra than those who tried to teach him. He struck out on his own as a young man to discover what already called to him. Ryze traveled the world, seeking the wisdom of powerful hermits, witches, and shamans - anyone who had something to share beyond what was taught in the city-states of Valoran. When he had learned all he could from these fonts of wisdom, Ryze turned to seek the lost, forgotten, and forbidden knowledge in the world, delving into mystical worlds where others feared to tread.\n\nRyze's tireless searching for magical knowledge led him to an ancient form of spellcraft known as thorn magic. This art required Ryze to tattoo spells on his body, permanently infusing his being with vast arcane power and finally fulfilling his need to bond with the mystical energies of Runeterra. His travels also led him to uncover the giant indestructible scroll he now carries on his back - the purpose of the inscribed spell remains a secret only Ryze knows. He claims it is an abomination - something that he must safeguard from the world. This has piqued the curiosity of many, though no one is sure how to separate the scroll from Ryze, or if it is possible to overcome the rogue mage to do so.

Only brute strength and the will to use it mattered to Noxus, and this is best exemplified in the murderous warrior, Sion.  Used by the Noxians as a human battering ram, Sion would be sent thundering ahead of Noxian troops.  He would mercilessly slaughter foes with his large double-bladed axe, \"Chopper\".

She was once a celestial being, but she sacrificed her immortality and entered the world of mortals. So long as evil threatens life in Valoran, Soraka will not allow herself peace.\n\nSoraka lived for centuries in an enchanted grove. A being of the stars, she healed the wounded and sick that sought her out. One man called Warwick came to her grove and begged her to heal his wife, who lay lifeless in his arms. His despair touched Soraka's heart. Though it was too late to save his wife, she offered to help heal the pain of his loss. Unwilling to let go of his grief Warwick ran from the grove, but returned over the following days to hear Soraka's guidance. She began to grow attached to the grieving man. One day Warwick told her he had found the men who killed his wife. He believed revenge would heal his pain - and if he died fighting, he would at least find peace. Though she pleaded with him, Warwick ignored her and left the grove. The voices of the stars warned her not to follow him, but Soraka had to intervene.\n\nShe stepped into the mortal world for the first time, and soon found Warwick desperately fighting a group of men. She tried to heal him, but for every wound she closed, the men inflicted two more. Soraka realized that she would have to fight to save her friend. The stars screamed in her mind, telling her not to use her powers for harm. Ignoring their warning, she struck the attackers with a flash of brilliant light. Crying out in terror and shielding their eyes from her divine radiance, they fled. Soraka's celestial form faded and the stars fell silent - for her transgression, she became mortal. She still felt the power of the stars within her, but they no longer offered her guidance. She took comfort in Warwick's safety, gently healing his wounds, but the man she had called her friend slipped a dagger between her ribs. As her blood spilled, Soraka realized he had fooled her, and everything he had done was a complicated ruse. Feeling humiliated and betrayed she called once more on the power of the stars, searing his flesh and cursing his cruelty. He retreated with an agonized howl, leaving Soraka to reflect upon her fate. Though her life had changed, she felt empowered and renewed with a singular purpose. No longer bound to the grove, Soraka set out into the mortal world, vowing to heal the wounded and protect the helpless."},"title":"the Starchild","icon":"Soraka_Square_0.png","select_sound":"en_US/Soraka.mp3","id":16},"17":{"skins":{"0":{"portrait":"Teemo_0.jpg","internal_name":"BaseTeemo","name":"","base":true,"splash":"Teemo_Splash_0.jpg","id":17000},"1":{"portrait":"Teemo_1.jpg","internal_name":"HappyElfTeemo","name":"Happy Elf Teemo","base":false,"splash":"Teemo_Splash_1.jpg","id":17001},"2":{"portrait":"Teemo_2.jpg","internal_name":"ReconTeemo","name":"Recon Teemo","base":false,"splash":"Teemo_Splash_2.jpg","id":17002},"3":{"portrait":"Teemo_3.jpg","internal_name":"BadgerTeemo","name":"Badger Teemo","base":false,"splash":"Teemo_Splash_3.jpg","id":17003},"4":{"portrait":"Teemo_4.jpg","internal_name":"AstronautTeemo","name":"Astronaut Teemo","base":false,"splash":"Teemo_Splash_4.jpg","id":17004},"5":{"portrait":"Teemo_5.jpg","internal_name":"EasterbunnyTeemo","name":"Cottontail Teemo","base":false,"splash":"Teemo_Splash_5.jpg","id":17005},"6":{"portrait":"Teemo_6.jpg","internal_name":"SuperTeemo","name":"Super Teemo","base":false,"splash":"Teemo_Splash_6.jpg","id":17006},"7":{"portrait":"Teemo_7.jpg","internal_name":"PandaTeemo","name":"Panda Teemo","base":false,"splash":"Teemo_Splash_7.jpg","id":17007},"count":8},"rating":{"magic":7,"defense":3,"attack":5,"difficulty":4},"tags":{"stealth":true,"support":true,"ranged":true},"internal_name":"Teemo","name":"Teemo","abilities":[{"cost":[70.0,80.0,90.0,100.0,110.0],"desc":"Obscures an enemy's vision with a powerful venom, dealing damage to the target unit and blinding it for the duration.","cooldown":[8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0],"tooltip_values":{"@Effect1Amount@":[80.0,125.0,170.0,215.0,260.0],"@CharAbilityPower@":0.80000000000000004,"@Effect2Amount@":[1.5,1.75,2.0,2.25,2.5]},"tooltip":"Deals @Effect1Amount@ (+@CharAbilityPower@) magic damage and blinds the target for @Effect2Amount@ seconds.

As far as yordles are concerned, there is something just slightly off about him. While Teemo enjoys the companionship of other yordles, he also insists on frequent solo missions in the ongoing defense of Bandle City. Despite his genuinely warm personality, something switches off inside Teemo's mind during combat so that the lives he must end while on patrol do not burden him. Even as a young recruit, the drill instructors and other trainees found it a little disconcerting that, while Teemo was normally charming and kind, he turned deadly serious and highly efficient the minute combat exercises began. Teemo's superiors quickly steered him toward the Scouts of the Mothership, which is one of Bandle City's most distinguished Special Forces unit alongside the Megling Commandos.\n\nWhile most yordles do not handle solo scouting missions with a great deal of finesse, Teemo is remarkably efficient at them. His record of success in defending Bandle City from infiltrators easily makes him one of the most dangerous yordles alive, though you'd never know it by having a cup of honey mead with him at his favorite inn. Bandle City chose Teemo as their first champion for the League, and he has taken to it like a duck to water. His signature weapon - a blowgun - uses a rare ajunta poison he personally gathers from the jungles of Kumungu. To help cope with his lengthy periods of isolation, Teemo recently struck up a friendship with Tristana, a fellow League champion and fellow member of Bandle City's Special Forces. This connection is healthy for both yordles, though now Valoran's voracious media outlets circulate rumors that the friendship is turning into a romantic relationship.

When his ambitions exceeded his physical limits, he drank a dangerous elixir to transform himself into an unstoppable manhunter.  His newfound strength bore a heavy price.\n\nBefore his transformation, Warwick found his calling in Zaun as a \"procurer\" of human test subjects. Known for his crafty methods and ruthless determination, people regarded him with a cautious mixture of fear and respect. As his reputation grew, so did the demands placed upon him. His clients wanted more rare and dangerous specimens, and they wanted them sooner. To meet their demands, Warwick needed strength that transcended his limited human form. His longtime friend, Singed, devised a powerful formula. The recipe called for three critical components: silver from the Shadow Isles, the fang of a Balefire dire wolf, and the heart of a celestial being. Warwick tracked down the first two in short order, but the third proved a much greater challenge. He traveled to Ionia to trap Soraka, a creature believed to be a child of the stars, but she discovered his ploy and drove him away with powerful magic. Unable to tolerate his failure, Warwick returned to Singed disfigured and furious. He demanded the chemist's incomplete potion, but Singed warned him that the results would be unpredictable. Ignoring his friend's warning, Warwick drank the concoction. The brew transformed him into a creature both man and wolf, infusing him with raw strength and heightened senses. Exhilarated, he immediately began testing his newfound power. Each day his instincts became sharper, but his human half slipped further away. He could feel himself losing control: though he always got his prey, he often failed to bring them back alive. Now he seeks the heart of Soraka to stabilize his transformation before his mind gives way to the feral urges of the beast."},"title":"the Blood Hunter","icon":"Warwick_Square_0.png","select_sound":"en_US/Warwick.mp3","id":19},"20":{"skins":{"0":{"portrait":"Nunu_0.jpg","internal_name":"BaseNunu","name":"","base":true,"splash":"Nunu_Splash_0.jpg","id":20000},"1":{"portrait":"Nunu_1.jpg","internal_name":"SasquatchNunu","name":"Sasquatch Nunu","base":false,"splash":"Nunu_Splash_1.jpg","id":20001},"2":{"portrait":"Nunu_2.jpg","internal_name":"WorkshopNunu","name":"Workshop Nunu","base":false,"splash":"Nunu_Splash_2.jpg","id":20002},"3":{"portrait":"Nunu_3.jpg","internal_name":"GrungyNunu","name":"Grungy Nunu","base":false,"splash":"Nunu_Splash_3.jpg","id":20003},"4":{"portrait":"Nunu_4.jpg","internal_name":"NunuBot","name":"Nunu Bot","base":false,"splash":"Nunu_Splash_4.jpg","id":20004},"5":{"portrait":"Nunu_5.jpg","internal_name":"NunuBattle","name":"Demolisher Nunu","base":false,"splash":"Nunu_Splash_5.jpg","id":20005},"count":6},"rating":{"magic":7,"defense":6,"attack":4,"difficulty":3},"tags":{"fighter":true,"melee":true,"jungler":true,"recommended":true},"internal_name":"Nunu","name":"Nunu","abilities":[{"cost":[60.0,60.0,60.0,60.0,60.0],"desc":"Nunu commands the yeti to take a bite out of a target minion or monster, dealing heavy damage to it and healing himself.","cooldown":[16.0,14.0,12.0,10.0,8.0],"tooltip_values":{"@Effect1Amount@":[500.0,600.0,700.0,800.0,900.0],"@CharAbilityPower@":1.0,"@Effect2Amount@":[125.0,180.0,235.0,290.0,345.0]},"tooltip":"Nunu commands the yeti to take a bite out of a minion or monster, dealing @Effect1Amount@ true damage to the target and healing himself for @Effect2Amount@ (+@CharAbilityPower@).","name":"Consume"},{"cost":[50.0,50.0,50.0,50.0,50.0],"desc":"Nunu invigorates himself and an allied unit by heating their blood, increasing their Movement and Attack Speeds.","cooldown":[15.0,15.0,15.0,15.0,15.0],"tooltip_values":{"@Effect1Amount@":[25.0,30.0,35.0,40.0,45.0],"@CharAbilityPower@":1.0,"@Effect2Amount@":[8.0,9.0,10.0,11.0,12.0],"@Effect3Amount@":[12.0,12.0,12.0,12.0,12.0]},"tooltip":"The heat of Nunu and a target ally's blood rises, increasing Movement Speed by @Effect2Amount@% and Attack Speed by @Effect1Amount@% for @Effect3Amount@ seconds.","name":"Blood Boil"},{"cost":[75.0,85.0,95.0,105.0,115.0],"desc":"Nunu launches a ball of ice at an enemy unit, dealing damage and temporarily slowing their Movement and Attack Speeds.","cooldown":[6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0],"tooltip_values":{"@Effect1Amount@":[85.0,130.0,175.0,225.0,275.0],"@Effect2Amount@":[20.0,30.0,40.0,50.0,60.0],"@Effect4Amount@":[3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0],"@Effect3Amount@":[25.0,25.0,25.0,25.0,25.0],"@CharAbilityPower@":1.0},"tooltip":"Nunu launches a ball of ice at an enemy unit, dealing @Effect1Amount@ (+@CharAbilityPower@) magic damage and slowing their Movement Speed by @Effect2Amount@% and Attack Speed by @Effect3Amount@% for @Effect4Amount@ seconds.","name":"Ice Blast"},{"cost":[150.0,150.0,150.0],"desc":"Nunu begins to sap the area of heat, slowing all nearby enemies.

One day when he was a young child, Nunu rode on his father's back as they returned from a trapping expedition in the mountains. An unexpected blizzard came upon them, forcing them to seek refuge in a cave. The tempest was the worst in countless years, and it lasted for days. Nunu's father left to find food, but he never returned.\n\nThe blizzard eventually cleared, and the young child lay dying on the mountainside. Fortunately for Nunu, this was the land of the yetis, who are powerful beasts with whom Nunu's father had secured an arrangement for safe passage. A young yeti boy named Willump found Nunu and brought him home. From then on Nunu was raised by the yetis, whose culture remains a mystery to most Runeterrans. The boy quickly discovered that the seemingly savage creatures were in fact deeply spiritual beings living in harmony with their environment. They are very territorial and unafraid of defending themselves if called upon to do so. The yetis have watched the rest of Valoran, and they can smell the change on the wind. When the League of Legends was formed, the yetis knew they needed a champion. Riding his brother Willump, Nunu became that champion.

No bounty was too difficult or too dangerous for her feminine charm and her renowned use of her twin pistols, \"Shock and Awe\". Her success gave her the means to legitimately purchase her own ship... with a little flirtatious haggling, of course. Things weren't always so fortunate for Miss Fortune, though.

Her front door was smashed open; inside, she saw her mother lying in a pool of blood. A sudden blow to her head made her collapse next to her slain mother. The last thing she could remember were her attacker's red eyes, as his face was blocked by a rogue's bandana. Miss Fortune has a strong distrust for pirates and she finds herself constantly bickering with the infamous Gangplank (the only captain to resist her charms) over the direction of Bilgewater politics. Her two goals: to unite the people of Bilgewater, making them into a strong and independent society, and to find the pirate who killed her mother.

Instead, they live in remote locales, often as part of a nomad or barbarian tribe. While perils abound in these untamed lands, there is also great freedom in being removed from the politics of Valoran. Tryndamere was born a member of one of these barbarian tribes in northern Valoran. Even as a young boy, it was obvious that he would grow in martial prowess to become one of his clan's greatest warriors. However, as his clan moved south between the Howling Marsh and the Ironspike Mountains, they came across strangers in black garb, brandishing symbols of a beast's skull. Despite Tryndamere's pleas, his elder went out to speak with the strangers; they cut him down mercilessly. From there, they began to slaughter every man, woman, and child in the clan. Tryndamere, the sole survivor, hid under the bodies of his dead parents. Upon their bloodied corpses, he swore eternal vengeance on those who took his people from him - the assassins of Noxus.\n\nTo train himself, Tryndamere voluntarily served under all the great chieftains of the barbarian tribes, learning the ways of the barbarian warrior. Not only did this make him the man he needed to become in order to exact his revenge, it has also garnered him friends and allies among the most powerful barbarian leaders of Valoran.

Such is the case with Jax, for whom the argument could be made that he is the most prolific tournament fighter currently at the Institute of War. Before joining the League, Jax was an unremarkable soldier-for-hire. For reasons known only to the former leader of the League, High Councilor Reginald Ashram, Jax was put on the top of the list of candidates to receive a League Judgment - the interview process that either accepts or rejects a prospective champion. His Judgment was the quickest in League history, where the Doors of Acceptance glowed and slowly swung open as soon as it began.  Jax faced no recorded Observation or Reflection during his Judgment.\n\nJax proved himself to be an immediate terror in the Fields of Justice. The self-proclaimed \"Armsmaster of the League\" rattled off a streak of consecutive wins that to this day has not been matched. A number of summoners in the League grew concerned that the perceived objectivity of the League of Legends would be questioned by the presence of an unknown fighter who was unbeatable. For this reason, the new leader of the League (following Reginald Ashram's disappearance), High Councilor Heyward Relivash, created special restrictions for Jax to fight under. This was something the League had never done before, and something that has never been done since. The burly fighter responded by imposing his own special conditions; as a means of protest, he permitted himself to fight using only a brass lamppost. Neither the League's sanctions nor his own has affected his winning ways.

The summoners who were responsible for its destruction had wisely left the Clock Tower unharmed, both to avoid drawing Zilean's attention and to torment him for his oversight.\n\nZilean barely had time to grieve the momentous loss before he learned that his dangerous research had a cruel side effect: chrono-displasia. This mystical disease granted him immortality, but detached his consciousness from its anchor in the present time. He now mentally drifts through time, from any point he has already lived to the present, unable to impact the events which unfold. The most torturous aspect of this curse is that Zilean sometimes experiences Urtistan as it once was and the rest of the time resides in its lonely ruins. Only the powerful summoning magic employed by members of the League of Legends has been able to treat this condition, and Zilean has joined in hopes of finding a cure, and thereafter a way to save his people."},"title":"the Chronokeeper","icon":"Zilean_Square_0.png","select_sound":"en_US/Zilean.mp3","id":26},"27":{"skins":{"0":{"portrait":"Singed_0.jpg","internal_name":"BaseSinged","name":"","base":true,"splash":"Singed_Splash_0.jpg","id":27000},"1":{"portrait":"Singed_1.jpg","internal_name":"RiotChemicalMan","name":"Riot Squad Singed","base":false,"splash":"Singed_Splash_1.jpg","id":27001},"2":{"portrait":"Singed_2.jpg","internal_name":"HextechChemicalMan","name":"Hextech Singed","base":false,"splash":"Singed_Splash_2.jpg","id":27002},"3":{"portrait":"Singed_3.jpg","internal_name":"SurferChemicalMan","name":"Surfer Singed","base":false,"splash":"Singed_Splash_3.jpg","id":27003},"4":{"portrait":"Singed_4.jpg","internal_name":"MadScientistChemicalman","name":"Mad Scientist Singed","base":false,"splash":"Singed_Splash_4.jpg","id":27004},"5":{"portrait":"Singed_5.jpg","internal_name":"ExperimentChemicalman","name":"Augmented Singed","base":false,"splash":"Singed_Splash_5.jpg","id":27005},"count":6},"rating":{"magic":7,"defense":6,"attack":5,"difficulty":5},"tags":{"fighter":true,"melee":true},"internal_name":"Singed","name":"Singed","abilities":[{"cost":[13.0,13.0,13.0,13.0,13.0],"desc":"Leaves a trail of poison behind Singed, dealing damage to enemies caught in the path.","cooldown":[null,null,null,null,null],"tooltip_values":{"@Effect1Amount@":[22,34,46,58,70],"@CharAbilityPower@":0.29999999999999999},"tooltip":"Toggle: Singed lays a poisonous trail that deals @Effect1Amount@ (+@CharAbilityPower@) magic damage per second.","name":"Poison Trail"},{"cost":[70.0,80.0,90.0,100.0,110.0],"desc":"Throws a vial of mega adhesive on the ground, slowing enemies who walk on it.","cooldown":[14.0,14.0,14.0,14.0,14.0],"tooltip_values":{"@Effect1Amount@":[35.0,45.0,55.0,65.0,75.0],"@CharAbilityPower@":1.0,"@Effect2Amount@":[5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0],"@Effect3Amount@":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"tooltip":"Leaves a sticky area on the ground for @Effect2Amount@ seconds, slowing enemies in the area by @Effect1Amount@% (lasts @Effect3Amount@ second after leaving).","name":"Mega Adhesive"},{"cost":[100.0,110.0,120.0,130.0,140.0],"desc":"Damages target enemy unit and flings them into the air behind Singed.","cooldown":[10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0],"tooltip_values":{"@Effect1Amount@":[100.0,150.0,200.0,250.0,300.0],"@CharAbilityPower@":1.0},"tooltip":"Singed flings an enemy over his shoulder, dealing @Effect1Amount@ (+@CharAbilityPower@) magic damage.","name":"Fling"},{"cost":[150.0,150.0,150.0],"desc":"Singed drinks a potent brew of chemicals, granting him increased combat stats.","cooldown":[100.0,100.0,100.0],"tooltip_values":{"@Effect1Amount@":[35.0,50.0,65.0],"@CharAbilityPower@":1.0,"@Effect2Amount@":[25.0,25.0,25.0],"@Effect3Amount@":[10.0,15.0,20.0]},"tooltip":"Singed drinks a potent brew of chemicals, granting him @Effect1Amount@ Ability Power, Armor, Magic Resist, Movement Speed, Health Regeneration, and Mana Regeneration, as well as reducing the duration of disables by @Effect3Amount@% for @Effect2Amount@ seconds.","name":"Insanity Potion"}],"tips":{"as":["Poison Trail is very effective at farming and harassing, allowing Singed to dominate the flow of whatever lane he's in.","Use Insanity Potion to trick your opponents into chasing you through your Poison Trail.","Flinging enemies into your tower can deal heavy amounts of damage to them."],"against":["Keep your distance to avoid being Flung back into Singed's allies.","Singed needs to run close to your team to be effective.

It came as no surprise to anyone when he was selected for apprenticeship by the infamous Warwick, master apothecary on a lucrative retainer with the Noxian military during their campaign against Ionia. Within Warwick's laboratories, Singed toiled without end, rapidly absorbing every detail of his predecessor's deadly craft. Singed had little concern for the death and destruction that was the fruit of his labors. By the time the curse of lycanthropy descended to claim his master, Singed was poised and eager to make the transition from workhorse to innovator; he was ready to share his genius by bringing a new brand of suffering to the Ionian front. His zeal for progress was unquenchable, and when suitable test subjects proved to be in short supply, the eager chemist was often thought to turn his volatile mixtures on his own flesh.\n\nWhen the uneasy peace created by the League of Legends settled on the world, Singed journeyed to the one place where he was still able to showcase his beloved craft: the Institute of War. By this time he was barely even a man, his body both ruined and sustained by his ingenious craft. A thousand burns - accidents of shadow and flame - mar his ravaged form, and exposure to such harsh conditions has deadened his nerves, hardened his body, and strengthened his physique, transforming him into a veritable juggernaut.

Some theorize that she was cursed with a mild form of fantastical vampirism as a child.  Supporters of this theory contend that her ability to sap the very life essence of her opponents on (and off) the Fields of Justice, while still being able to tolerate direct sunlight, would account for this belief.

It is thought that the Shadow Isles are home to countless forms of undead, though no one seems eager to perform the exploration necessary to find out the truth.  Evelynn neither confirms nor denies her connection to Shadow Isles.\n\nThe power brokers of Valoran know that Evelynn's services come at the highest of premiums, and her recent addition to the League of Legends indicates that her ambitions are growing.  Her savagery on the Fields of Justice has been so great that new rumors about her origins are now circulating.

Karthus volunteered to tend to the sick and dying, though his intentions were not to help, but to closely witness the passing of those who were beyond help. Ultimately, he went so far as to elaborately stage his death, and he secretly observed his own funeral with intense fascination. When others discovered what Karthus had done, they were so shocked and disturbed that, in a way, he became truly dead to them.  Karthus found himself fully rejected by the living.\n\nHis isolation only served to fuel his obsession. Karthus delved further into his exploration of death, and became fascinated by the legends of the Shadow Isles. There, it was said, the specters of the deceased continued on in unlife everlasting. Possessed by these tales, he knew he had to discover for himself if they were true. Journeying to those dreaded isles, Karthus soon found himself wandering through the mist, overcome by the surreal beauty of the place. He felt as if he had finally come home. He had always chased the elusive purity of the moment of death, when life passed and in a single instant achieved meaning. Karthus saw that undeath was like that moment, preserved in dread stillness forever. He had discovered his destiny, to cross over the veil and leave the living behind for eternity. Something awoke in the Shadow Isles that day, when Karthus did something no other creature had ever done: he willingly gave  his life over to undeath. When he reentered the world, Karthus had become the embodiment of his own obsession. An undying lich with the keys to life and death, he seeks to bring his dark requiem to the world."},"title":"the Deathsinger","icon":"Karthus_Square_0.png","select_sound":"en_US/Karthus.mp3","id":30},"31":{"skins":{"0":{"portrait":"Chogath_0.jpg","internal_name":"BaseChogath","name":"","base":true,"splash":"Chogath_Splash_0.jpg","id":31000},"1":{"portrait":"Chogath_1.jpg","internal_name":"NightmareChogath","name":"Nightmare Cho'Gath","base":false,"splash":"Chogath_Splash_1.jpg","id":31001},"2":{"portrait":"Chogath_2.jpg","internal_name":"DandyChogath","name":"Gentleman Cho'Gath","base":false,"splash":"Chogath_Splash_2.jpg","id":31002},"3":{"portrait":"Chogath_3.jpg","internal_name":"AbyssChogath","name":"Loch Ness Cho'Gath","base":false,"splash":"Chogath_Splash_3.jpg","id":31003},"4":{"portrait":"Chogath_4.jpg","internal_name":"DinosaurChogath","name":"Jurassic Cho'Gath","base":false,"splash":"Chogath_Splash_4.jpg","id":31004},"5":{"portrait":"Chogath_5.jpg","internal_name":"BattlecastChogath","name":"Battlecast Prime Cho'Gath","base":false,"splash":"Chogath_Splash_5.jpg","id":31005},"count":6},"rating":{"magic":8,"defense":4,"attack":3,"difficulty":7},"tags":{"fighter":true,"melee":true,"mage":true},"internal_name":"Chogath","name":"Cho'Gath","abilities":[{"cost":[90.0,90.0,90.0,90.0,90.0],"desc":"Ruptures the ground at target location, popping enemy units into the air, dealing damage and slowing them.","cooldown":[9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0],"tooltip_values":{"@Effect1Amount@":[80.0,135.0,190.0,245.0,305.0],"@CharAbilityPower@":1.0},"tooltip":"Ruptures the ground at target location.

Cho'Gath is a creature born of the Void, a thing whose true nature is so awful most will not speak its name.

What few know, however, is that phoenixes are elemental beings, formed by the eternal essences of their native world. Anivia was conceived on a world such as this - a being of the coldest winter, a creature of pure elemental ice. On her world, Anivia was the protector of the frozen wastes and all those with the spirit to endure in such unforgiving places. She was consulted as a creature of great wisdom, one who could not die and who had seen the world renewed several times. Somehow, Anivia knew that the day would come when she would be plucked from her home and pulled across worlds, and when that day came, she received the call with grace. Seeing the imbalance and injustice on Runeterra, a world lacking elemental protectors, Anivia took her place at the League of Legends.\n\nSince her arrival, the Cryophoenix has chosen to live among the highest peaks of the Northern Ironspike Mountains, adjacent to the frozen wastes of Freljord. She has openly claimed this territory as her own protectorate. Surprisingly, Anivia has struck up a friendship with the yeti of this region - a friendship that grows deeper and deeper with each passing moon. She has formed a close bond with two League champions: Nunu (and Willump) and the nomad princess Ashe. In a move that caught the League by surprise, the Cryophoenix recently entreated the summoners of the Institute of War to research a means in bringing across others of her elemental fellows. As a champion, Anivia is revered with a sense of awe by most, but is not the most popular as most consider her unapproachable.\n\nSome say the world will end in fire, some in ice.

By his teenage years, his parents were nowhere to be found. By the time he had legally acquired his license to practice medicine, he had been acquitted of thirty-eight separate charges of murder by the Zaun authorities; the lack of evidence made prosecution impossible.\n\nDr. Mundo has become equal parts serial killer and mad scientist, though no one is entirely sure how his butchery qualifies as science. However, he has made tremendous strides in mapping the pain response in the human brain and body, going so far as being able to suppress it, even in the most excruciating of circumstances. He has also tapped into the primal parts of the brain through chemistry, learning how to enhance aggression and adrenaline, as well as dulling conscience and the survival instinct. In short, Dr. Mundo's life's work has been how to create the perfect science-enhanced killer.  Unfortunately, the city-state of Noxus regards such behavior as a sign of initiative and ambition, rather than inhumanity. Originally fighting for Zaun, Dr. Mundo was recruited to also fight for Noxus in the League of Legends; the Madman dual faction status represents the fruits of a blossoming relationship between Zaun and Noxus.

She was an unusually well-behaved child, always quiet and content. Her caretakers were sure she would find a home quickly, but it soon became apparent that what they mistook for uncommon geniality was actually an inability to speak or to produce any sound whatsoever. Sona remained at the adoption house until her teens, watching in hopeless silence as prospective adopters passed her by. During this time, the caretakers sold her unusual instrument to anxious collectors, hoping to build her a trust. For a myriad of bizarre and unexpected reasons, however, it would be returned, or simply appear again outside the house.\n\nWhen a wealthy Demacian woman named Lestara Buvelle learned of the instrument, she immediately embarked to Ionia. When the caretakers showcased the instrument for her, she rose wordlessly and explored the house, stopping outside Sona's room. Without hesitation, Lestara adopted her and left a generous donation for the instrument. With Lestara's guidance, Sona discovered a deep connection with the instrument which Lestara called an 'etwahl'. In her hands, it played tones which stilled or quivered the hearts of those around her. Within months, she was headlining with the mysterious etwahl for sold-out audiences.

Master Lito was a swordsman whose teachings were sought by ruling classes from nearly every city-state. His art was a highly-guarded secret, but it was said that swords would breathe in his grasp. He withered unexpectedly from a mysterious disease which baffled the brightest of Runeterran physicians. When he died, he left behind Zelos and Irelia, his son and daughter, and a truly unique weapon.

At the Great Stand of the Placidium, Ionians prepared for surrender, but were inspired to maintain their resistance when the young Irelia lifted her father's enormous blade and pledged to hold until her brother returned. In the chaos of the ensuing fight, Irelia was cursed with dark Noxian Necromancy. As her life ebbed, Soraka, the Starchild, made a final attempt to anchor her fading soul. Unwilling to relinquish her home, Irelia rose at the brink of death, and her father's sword lifted in the air alongside her. Irelia rushed back to the fore, unfazed by the blade's sudden animation. The weapon danced around her effortlessly, cutting down Noxians as they gaped in horror. The decimated invaders were forced to retreat from the Placidium.

He thrived on danger, and enjoyed nothing more than a good dogfight in the morning.

While her peers explored the torrent of emotions that came with adolescence, Karma meditated in the Lotus Gardens. She was convinced that the true path to enlightenment was a journey inward, to a place within the self, overlooked by most. She exuded such inner contentment that she quickly became a go-to mediator and confidante in her village. Her instructors used to say: \"That girl can not only weather a storm, but calm it.\" Karma did not live extravagantly; her parents owned a local business selling antiques in the Navori province and they often struggled to provide for themselves, though they did so with cheery optimism. Her most prized possessions were two exquisite fans taken from her family's shop.\n\nWhen Noxian troops invaded southern Ionia, her village was one of the first to fall. The villages who survived the assault were captured by Noxian forces. It was then that Karma found her calling. By exploiting the insecurities of the Noxian commander, she negotiated the safe release of the villages to the northern lands. She was present at the Placidium, where the Elders had considered surrender until Irelia's impassioned last stand renewed the Ionian's hope. Karma used this hope to solidify the Elders' commitment to remain defiant against the Noxian onslaught. For her devotion and charisma, Karma was made the figurehead of the Ionian resistance. She never compromised, and she shared every hardship with her people, even when it came to combat. By tapping into her inner resilience, she discovered that she could bring great force to bear against her foes on the battlefield. She modified her fans into lethal implements, and was tutored by Janna to enhance their effects.

Back home, Taric's father was a distinguished healer in their home city. Taric was always interested in his father's pursuits, even from a young age. Despite his burgeoning understanding of herbs, plants, and animal medicines, it was the power of gems that most fascinated the growing boy. It wasn't long before Taric had exhausted his father's coveted library and set out on a path of his own. He wanted to help the people, but not by simply salving their wounds and curing their woes. He wasn't to be a healer, but a defender - one who used the power of earth to preserve and protect.\n\nTaric became a wandering knight, renowned across his homeland as a guardian of the just until the day a spell of summoning grabbed him from his home and deposited him on Runeterra. Though disoriented and confused at first, he now feels that the continent of Valoran is in need of someone like him. Despite missing his homeland, Taric is happy to fight in the League, serving as a protector for all who seek one. His neat and stylish appearance combined with his shiny bejeweled armor and weapons have rapidly made him a celebrity champion of the League of Legends.

The easygoing half-pint race, though fierce, is often regarded with some degree of joviality. Their high-pitched voices and naturally cute forms inspire something of a protective instinct in the larger races, or at least bring to mind images of children playing at being adults. Every now and again, however, a yordle turns so bad that even at its small stature it strikes terror into the hearts of others. Veigar is one such twisted yordle. As a master of the magical black arts, as well as a corrupter of cosmic energy, he is one of the most powerful sorcerers on Valoran.\n\nAs a child, Veigar was a normal yordle with one small exception - he had a deep curiosity for the world beyond Bandle City. The young yordle spent much of his time studying the rest of Valoran, and he jumped at the chance to join a business that traded with other major city-states. Unfortunately for both him and the world, a deal with Noxian trader turned into shady business and went bad; Veigar and his companions were subsequently set up to take the fall. Arrested by the authorities, he was imprisoned within the walls of Noxus for years. Such isolation is very dangerous for yordles - undoubtedly why his cruel jailers did such a thing - and Veigar was slowly driven mad.\n\nHe eventually escaped, having become a twisted version of his former self. Instead of returning to his people and Bandle City, he sought tutelage from dark wizards across the land. With his demented will focused on one task, he quickly became a dangerous and powerful wizard in his own right. Now he seeks to end all conflict on Valoran by bringing all of the city-states to their knees, regardless of their affiliation. The League of Legends is the perfect tool to help him meet his ends - for now.\n\nWho says evil needs to come in a fearsome-looking package?"},"title":"the Tiny Master of Evil","icon":"Veigar_Square_0.png","select_sound":"en_US/Veigar.mp3","id":45},"48":{"skins":{"0":{"portrait":"Trundle_0.jpg","internal_name":"BaseTrundle","name":"","base":true,"splash":"Trundle_Splash_0.jpg","id":48000},"1":{"portrait":"Trundle_1.jpg","internal_name":"BaseballTrundle","name":"Lil' Slugger Trundle","base":false,"splash":"Trundle_Splash_1.jpg","id":48001},"2":{"portrait":"Trundle_2.jpg","internal_name":"JunkyardTrundle","name":"Junkyard Trundle","base":false,"splash":"Trundle_Splash_2.jpg","id":48002},"count":3},"rating":{"magic":2,"defense":6,"attack":7,"difficulty":5},"tags":{"fighter":true,"melee":true},"internal_name":"Trundle","name":"Trundle","abilities":[{"cost":[40.0,40.0,40.0,40.0,40.0],"desc":"Trundle bites his opponent, dealing damage and sapping some of their attack damage.","cooldown":[4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0],"tooltip_values":{"@Effect1Amount@":[30.0,45.0,60.0,75.0,90.0],"@CharAbilityPower@":0.40000000000000002,"@Effect2Amount@":[20.0,25.0,30.0,35.0,40.0]},"tooltip":"Trundle bites his opponent instead of attacking for his next standard attack, dealing @Effect1Amount@ (+@f1@) physical damage.\n\nThis attack increases Trundle's Attack Damage by @Effect2Amount@ for 8 seconds, with his opponent losing half of this amount.","name":"Rabid Bite"},{"cost":[60.0,60.0,60.0,60.0,60.0],"desc":"Trundle infects a target location with his curse, gaining attack speed, movement speed, and crowd control reduction while on it.","cooldown":[15.0,15.0,15.0,15.0,15.0],"tooltip_values":{"@Effect1Amount@":[20.0,25.0,30.0,35.0,40.0],"@CharAbilityPower@":0,"@Effect2Amount@":[20.0,30.0,40.0,50.0,60.0],"@Effect3Amount@":[20.0,25.0,30.0,35.0,40.0]},"tooltip":"Trundle affects target location with his curse for 8 seconds, gaining @Effect1Amount@% Movement Speed, @Effect2Amount@% Attack Speed and @Effect3Amount@% Crowd Control Reduction while on it.","name":"Contaminate"},{"cost":[60.0,60.0,60.0,60.0,60.0],"desc":"Trundle creates a plagued beacon at target location, becoming impassable terrain and slowing all nearby enemy units.","cooldown":[23.0,20.0,17.0,14.0,11.0],"tooltip_values":{"@CharAbilityPower@":0,"@Effect2Amount@":[25.0,30.0,35.0,40.0,45.0]},"tooltip":"Trundle creates a plagued beacon at target location, becoming impassable terrain and slowing all nearby enemy units by @Effect2Amount@%.","name":"Pillar of Filth"},{"cost":[75.0,75.0,75.0],"desc":"Trundle immediately steals his target's health and a percent of their armor and magic resistance.

They are creatures relegated to the murky recesses of the world, hidden away from most intelligent beings. Despite their maleficent natures, however, the Ruhgosk never deserved the grisly fate that was visited upon them. Generations ago, a twisted necromancer known as Hakolin the Bonecrafter attempted to enslave the Ruhgosk tribe. These trolls are considerably more genteel than their ill-mannered brethren, although still uncouth by human standards. The Ruhgosk fought tooth and claw against the necromancer, ultimately driving him from their land. As a parting gift, Hakolin afflicted the trolls with a leprous disease, forever cursing the members of the tribe. The leprosy would have rotted their flesh away to nothing were it not for the trolls' natural ability to regenerate. Caught forever in a hideous rotting state, the Ruhgosk endured their curse while desperately in search of a cure. They never found one.\n\nA wise Ruhgosk shaman learned that he could magically bind the disease to a single troll, provided that the troll could bear the weight of the entire tribe's curse upon himself. However, there was no such troll...until the birth of Trundle. His ability to regenerate was so profound that it appeared as if he did not carry the disease. As Trundle grew, he came to understand his gift and what it could do for his people. When he came of age, he took the curse from his tribe in a baptism of searing agony. Through the shaman's ritual, Trundle became a horrifying creature whose flesh constantly sloughs off his body, only to be re-grown in an unremitting cycle.

The doctor gawked in horror as the young adolescent answered questions about his health and age with a calm, even stare. Even behind the echoing crack as the sand counterweights reset his tibia, Swain's measuring gaze never flickered, nor did his eyes twitch from the pop of his fibula. He refused the doctor's recommendation of magical treatment for the leg's inoperable damage, requesting only a spare crutch before shuffling away. He next surfaced in documents from the Noxian military, although it is evident that they are incomplete. Normally a crippled boy would be turned away in shame from Noxus' proud legion, but the records indicate his first designation was that of a ranking officer.\n\nThe men who've served under him (and survived) have remained in his charge with unshakable faith and loyalty. He leapt through the High Command's hierarchy, often ascending when superiors requested demotions to join his unit. A cunning strategist, Swain was decorated after every battle he fought, regularly hobbling in contemplation at the front of the assault. His rise to power seemed unceasing until he was suddenly relegated to inactive status prior to the Ionian Invasion - a bewildering decision which reeked of bureaucratic subversion. If Swain was upset by the events which unfolded, he never belied it. His face was so implacable that it was popularly rumored to be a mask, disguising something utterly inhuman beneath.

Some even theorize that it would have fallen long ago to the chaos of organized crime if not for Caitlyn, the Sheriff of Piltover. Born the daughter of a wealthy statesman and a pioneering hextech researcher, Caitlyn discovered her natural gift for investigation when, at age 14, her father was assaulted and robbed on his way home. She snuck out of her house that night with her father's rifle and tracked down the muggers from the crime scene. At first, her parents did their best to discourage her from such risky hobbies, but she was incorrigible. Wishing to protect her daughter in the only way she knew how, Caitlyn's mother began outfitting her with techmaturgical devices tailored to her sleuthing needs.\n\nCaitlyn quickly gained notoriety, both because she was single handedly defeating crime in Piltover and also because she soon developed into a ravishing beauty. She never backed down from a case or a challenge, and she was one of the sharpest shots in the city-state. Her services were soon requested by Demacia to help track down a mysterious outlaw who had begun committing high-profile heists. The bandit, who always left a card with an ornate 'C' at the scene of the crime, became Caitlyn's arch-nemesis.

The unchecked nature of experimentation has taken its toll on the city.  However, Zaun's lenient restrictions allow their researchers and inventors the leeway to push the bounds of science at an accelerated rate, for better or worse.  It was under these conditions that a team of doctoral students from Zaun's College of Techmaturgy made a breakthrough in the field of intelligent steam automation.  Their creation, the steam golem Blitzcrank, was developed to exercise judgment on-the-fly in order to assist with Zaun's hazardous waste reclamation process, since so often the conditions did not allow for human supervision.  However, he soon began exhibiting unforeseen behaviors.\n\nOver time, the scientists were able to identify a demonstrated learning process, and Blitzcrank fast became a celebrity.  As is sadly often the case though, credit for the golem's creation was scooped up by another - Professor Stanwick Pididly - though most now know the truth.  In the wake of the ensuing legal maelstrom, it became evident that neither party truly had the steam golem's best interests at heart, and Blitzcrank humbly petitioned for personal autonomy.  Backed by overwhelming support from the public, it took the liberal Council of Zaun only a few weeks to declare Blitzcrank a fully-independent, sentient entity.  A unique being, the golem left Zaun, distressed by the controversy and feeling there was no place he could fit in.  His travels led him to the one location in Valoran where unique beings have a place - the League of Legends.

As the daughter of a prominent Noxian general many paths were open to her, but she rejected them all for the path of the blade. Rigorously trained by the finest assassins in Noxus, her father the best among them, it was not long before Katarina demanded her first assignment. The task they gave her was aggravatingly simple: assassinate a low-ranking Demacian officer. As she set to her work infiltrating the enemy camp, Katarina discovered an opportunity too tantalizing to pass by - the arrival of a Demacian General. Stalking him to his tent, she quietly dispatched his guards and slit his throat. Pleased with her impressive kill, she disappeared into the night. Katarina's elation faded the next day when her original objective, the Demacian officer, led his forces to ambush unprepared Noxian soldiers. Though the Noxians fought valiantly, they suffered heavy casualties. Furious at her mistake, Katarina set off to complete her original task. Returning to the camp, she spied her now heavily guarded target and realized a stealthy kill was no longer possible. Drawing her blades, Katarina swore the officer would die, no matter the cost. She leapt into battle, unleashing a whirlwind of steel. One by one blades flashed and guards fell, each strike bringing her one step closer to the officer. A final thrown dagger restored her honor.

Physicians were baffled until a Field Architect happened to pass out next to a nexus on Twisted Treeline. Witnesses said he cried out once and then stopped breathing. Immediately after, magical energy arced out from the nexus, and Nocturne appeared.\n\nNocturne did not take his introduction to this world kindly. He slaughtered everything he could find before summoners were able to magically confine him. After a period of intense study, League experts divined that Nocturne hunted summoners in their sleep, attacking them in a place where their magic was useless. This seemed to be his only purpose. The families of the victims demanded justice, but League officials were concerned that death might only return Nocturne to the place from which he came. They bound him to a nexus fragment, trapping him in the physical world. As punishment for his crimes, they allowed summoners to call upon Nocturne in the League matches, bending his will to the summoners he hates and creating his own personal nightmare. League scholars don't know whether he truly came from the plane of dreams, or whether there are any more like him. Some theorize that the summoning act affected summoners' subconscious minds, luring Nocturne to them in their sleep. Perhaps the most disturbing theory is that Nocturne is a person's nightmare come to life. If this is true, they wonder, who is the dreamer?"},"title":"the Eternal Nightmare","icon":"Nocturne_Square_0.png","select_sound":"en_US/Nocturne.mp3","id":56},"57":{"skins":{"0":{"portrait":"Maokai_0.jpg","internal_name":"BaseMaokai","name":"","base":true,"splash":"Maokai_Splash_0.jpg","id":57000},"1":{"portrait":"Maokai_1.jpg","internal_name":"BurntMaokai","name":"Charred Maokai","base":false,"splash":"Maokai_Splash_1.jpg","id":57001},"2":{"portrait":"Maokai_2.jpg","internal_name":"TotemMaokai","name":"Totemic Maokai","base":false,"splash":"Maokai_Splash_2.jpg","id":57002},"3":{"portrait":"Maokai_3.jpg","internal_name":"ChristmasMaokai","name":"Festive Maokai","base":false,"splash":"Maokai_Splash_3.jpg","id":57003},"4":{"portrait":"Maokai_4.jpg","internal_name":"GraveDiggerMaokai","name":"Haunted Maokai","base":false,"splash":"Maokai_Splash_4.jpg","id":57004},"count":5},"rating":{"magic":6,"defense":8,"attack":3,"difficulty":4},"tags":{"tank":true,"pusher":true,"melee":true},"internal_name":"Maokai","name":"Maokai","abilities":[{"cost":[55.0,55.0,55.0,55.0,55.0],"desc":"Maokai knocks back nearby enemies with a shockwave, dealing magic damage and slowing them.","cooldown":[6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0],"tooltip_values":{"@Effect1Amount@":[70.0,115.0,160.0,205.0,250.0],"@CharAbilityPower@":0.40000000000000002,"@Effect3Amount@":[20.0,27.0,34.0,41.0,48.0]},"tooltip":"Maokai releases an arcane shockwave.

By limiting its use to there, they thought that they could prevent it from doing further harm to the environment.  It seemed that they were successful until Maokai came into being.  During a League match on The Twisted Treeline, Maokai, an ancient oak that stood above the upper jungle, spontaneously roared to life.  Ripped from the natural balance by arcane forces, his sentience was forged in chaos.  Before the Adjudicators of the League could step in and suppress him, he slew all six champions participating in the match.  The scholars of the Arcanum Majoris took a keen interest in him, as they were eager to discover the secrets of his animation.\n\nMaokai was furious, however.  He abhorred the existence that was thrust upon him; he felt it was a corruption of nature.  He learned to communicate with people in hopes of finding a way to be returned to his former, true state.  Seizing the opportunity, the League offered a trade.  They would research a way to revert him so long as he agreed to fight in the League of Legends.  Maokai was indifferent to verdicts rendered by the League, but he was eager to punish summoners for their wanton use of magic.  He agreed to the terms under one condition: once they learned how to turn him back, they would never animate another tree again.

While the enlightened Nasus taught those scholars who came to study, Renekton served as the Great Library's gatekeeper. He could sense the true natures of those who sought Nasus' teachings, and he sent away those with dark ambitions. Over time, however, his repeated exposure to this evil infected his mind. He grew furious with the malevolence in the hearts of men, and as he descended deeper into madness, he discovered he could quell the fury by cutting the evil from the men who possessed it. Unfortunately, the relief was as short-lived as the subjects, and the \"butcher's rage\", as it came to be known, would resurge even stronger.\n\nConsumed by his anger, Renekton turned on the one being who could defeat him -- his own brother. Nasus pleaded with Renekton to see reason. Realizing that he was beyond redemption, the despondent Nasus valiantly struck down his wayward sibling. Defenseless, Renekton waited eagerly for death's release. It never came. He was spared when summoners from the League of Legends claimed his brother. Caught in the wake of this powerful spell, Renekton tumbled for what seemed like ages between realities. When he finally emerged, he fell deep into the sewers of Zaun. Insane with fury, Renekton languished in his newfound home, driven senseless by his rage. That is until, by happenstance, he caught a familiar scent in the air.

Though Orianna had incredible talent for dancing, she was deeply fascinated by the champions of the League of Legends. This fascination compelled her to begin training to become such a champion. It is unfortunate that her sheltered, wide-eyed naivete led her to take unnecessary and dangerous chances which ultimately led to her tragic demise. Orianna's death shattered Corin, driving him into deep depression and an obsession with techmaturgy. He could not stand the void his daughter's death left in his life, so he decided to build a replacement - one that would complete Orianna's dream of joining the League. What was created is the clockwork killing machine that Corin named after his daughter. Knowing that she was destined to be a champion and seeing the way the times were changing, he created The Ball as her pet and protector. This nearly symbiotic creation uses a different type of techmaturgy, relying more heavily on electricity than clockwork.\n\nOrianna and The Ball now fight as Champions in the League of Legends, using her sometimes misguided morality as a compass. She tries in earnest to fit in with those around her.  However, no matter how hard she tries, Orianna can never be human and there is always something unnerving and alien about her. Though she attempts social interaction with other champions in the League of Legends, there are few who can get past her exotic nature.

It remained there, untouched for centuries, emanating a potent magic which infused nearby wildlife with sentience and vitality. A group of monkeys who were particularly empowered by it came to worship the stone, and their leader - a wise sage - became convinced that he could harness its power to make the monkeys immortal. He performed an elaborate ritual, but things didn't go as he expected. The runestone was destroyed, and instead of granting immortality, it produced Kong, a monkey who carried in his heart the strength and power it had contained. Kong was driven by an unquenchable desire for greatness. He sought out every beast and monster the Plague Jungles could offer, eager to find a worthy opponent, but none offered the challenge he craved. He asked the sage for advice, and learned about a legend of hairless monkeys to the north who, with wits and might, had bent the world to their will.\n\nWukong left, journeying north, determined to discover if the legend was true. He crossed the Southern Wastes and then the Great Barrier. On his way, he happened upon Master Yi, who was deep in meditation. Kong asked him who the strongest warrior in the north was, and Yi told him about the League of Legends. The tale intoxicated Kong, a place where he could battle the strongest fighters in the world was, to him, paradise. Kong asked Yi to introduce him to this League, and to teach him the ways of humans, so that he could be a fitting champion. In return, he would honor Yi by using Yi's Wuju style to become the greatest warrior Runeterra had ever seen. Admiring his passion, Yi agreed, but under the condition that Kong would one day teach the lessons of Wuju to a pupil of his own. In the spirit of this agreement, he renamed Kong \"Wukong,\" and gave him a weapon suited to his unusual nature - an enchanted staff that the young Doran had crafted.

While studying at the Arcanum Majoris, Lee Sin became frustrated with instruction paced for the other students. He spent his free time researching the nuances of summoning in hopes of graduating sooner. He made amazing advances in his arcane studies, surpassing all other students. By all indications, he would have become one of the League's greatest summoners were it not for one terrible mistake. Too impatient, he attempted to test his ability by summoning a beast from the Plague Jungles. What he summoned instead was a young boy, but not in one piece. He barely had time to look the boy in what was once his face before the jumbled human mass fell lifeless to the floor. A League investigation later revealed that the boy's entire village was obliterated by feedback from the ritual.\n\nLee Sin's talents were so promising that the League was willing to overlook the incident, but he could never forgive himself. He left the Institute and journeyed to the Shojin Monastery for eternal repentance, swearing never to practice magic again. Years later, hoping to atone for his crime with martyrdom, he set himself ablaze as a protest of the Noxian occupation of Ionia. He remained alive in this state, enduring searing agony for weeks. His actions paved the way for a League match wherein Ionia prevailed, but by the time he was doused, his eyes had been burned completely from their sockets. Hailed as a savior, he was reborn, and his will to act invigorated.

Cunning as she was beautiful, the temptress could never be found far from the arm of any foreign dignitary, her wiles prying secrets from the lips of even the most wary attache. With the Noxian barbarian pacification campaign having ground to a standstill, Cassiopeia had set her sights on a diplomat from a tribe of the Freljord region. Thinking him an easy mark, the scheming seductress set about beguiling him. He refused to confide in her, however, until she swore an oath of secrecy upon his sword - a strange weapon with a serpentine curve to the blade. \n\nOnce her tryst was over, Cassiopeia provisioned her father with information regarding the barbarian resistance. As she divulged this intelligence, a wave of revulsion washed over her. She screamed in agony as her silky skin hardened to scales, her lustrous hair thickened to leather, and her manicured fingernails sharpened to claws. Dazed, she fell upon a group of horrified servants, rending them limb from limb in a heartbeat. When it was over the blood-soaked figure was no longer the ravishing jewel of the Noxian court, but a horror trapped somewhere between woman and serpent. Unable to serve in her traditional capacity, Cassiopeia departed for the League, continuing her service to Noxus on the Fields of Justice."},"title":"the Serpent's Embrace","icon":"Cassiopeia_Square_0.png","select_sound":"en_US/Cassiopeia.mp3","id":69},"72":{"skins":{"0":{"portrait":"Skarner_0.jpg","internal_name":"BaseSkarner","name":"","base":true,"splash":"Skarner_Splash_0.jpg","id":72000},"1":{"portrait":"Skarner_1.jpg","internal_name":"SkarnerScorpion","name":"Sandscourge Skarner","base":false,"splash":"Skarner_Splash_1.jpg","id":72001},"2":{"portrait":"Skarner_2.jpg","internal_name":"SkarnerRunes","name":"Earthrune Skarner","base":false,"splash":"Skarner_Splash_2.jpg","id":72002},"count":3},"rating":{"magic":5,"defense":6,"attack":7,"difficulty":5},"tags":{"fighter":true,"melee":true,"jungler":true},"internal_name":"Skarner","name":"Skarner","abilities":[{"cost":[20.0,22.0,24.0,26.0,28.0],"desc":"Skarner lashes out with his claws, dealing physical damage to all nearby enemies and charging himself with Crystal Energy for several seconds if a unit is struck.

The Brackern were unusual beings blessed with the earth's primal magic, embodied in the form of crystals. Their kind knew of an arcane ritual to bind their life's essence to a crystal, communing with the magic embedded in it. With this power, the Brackern thrived in the Odyn Valley, protecting both creatures and crystals alike. Despite attacks from those looking to claim the primal magic, it seemed that nothing could get past the Brackern's defenses. Nothing, that is, until the devastation of a Rune War.\n\nA vicious battle was fought near the Odyn Valley and the unleashed chaotic magic poisoned the crystals. The Brackern began to grow sick and die, and no amount of defensive magic could reverse the effects. To avoid extinction, their only course was to hibernate underground until the wars stopped. The strongest, most intelligent Brackern hibernated closer to the surface to awaken first and assess the world's condition for the return of their race. The recent mining operations and violent escalation in Kalamanda were enough to awaken the first of these vanguards. When Skarner burst to the surface, he lashed out in anger and confusion. Reason eventually won out over his anger when he realized that the agents of the League who found him were simply functionaries. Skarner was invited to the Institute of War to share the Brackern's story. In return, the summoners told him about the history that his kind had slept through. Much had been done to curb the unchecked use of magic since the Rune Wars, but it was obvious that the world was not yet safe for his kind to reawaken.

Unfortunately, there were others of his kind that believed they were more than protectors. They were under the egotistical delusion that they had ascended to become gods.

He welled with pride the day she was first able to lift his trusty hammer, Whomper.  Poppy immediately took to his art, demonstrating a natural gift for smithing, which Blomgrun honed with devoted instruction.\n\nOne day, a Demacian general named Florin Berell commissioned Blomgrun to craft a helm, glorious beyond comparison.

When the pair finished, they departed for Demacia to deliver it in person.  Word of the general's order, however, was leaked to the Noxian High Command, and two Noxian assassins were dispatched to intercept the delivery.  Blomgrun was able to occupy the assassins long enough for Poppy to escape with the prized helm.  She watched helplessly from the brush as her father was slain.  Instead of fleeing home, she carried the helm the rest of the way to Demacia alone.  She refused payment for it, saying that no amount would compensate for her father's life.  Instead, she offered it as a gift, honoring her father's final intentions.  Florin saw the grim determination behind the tears in her eyes, and requested that the leadership of Bandle City appoint Poppy as the yordle ambassador to Demacia.

Only those with great fortitude and endurance dwell in what is perhaps the most rugged and unforgiving environment anywhere on the face of Runeterra.

This behemoth of a man has long eschewed the rigors of civilization for what he calls his \"slice of paradise;\" he has no neighbors to bother him and plenty of space to pursue his life's ambition - brewing.  Grogs, ales, meads, and wine - nothing is beyond his skill to brew. What makes Gragas a truly special brewmaster, however, is his proximity to a large and powerful nexus.\n\nThe magic of this nexus has seeped into his fermented creations, and Gragas has consumed enough of his own poison over the years to slake the thirst of an army. This arcane alcohol has caused Gragas to swell both in height and girth; he looms over the tallest of men and boasts nearly twice their width.

Ezreal, however, was also born with a much stronger sense of wanderlust. Put into school to become a skilled techmaturgist, Ezreal quickly became bored with magical studies. By the time the boy genius was eight years old, he had fully mapped out the underground tunnels of Piltover. The quality of his work was so great that the government of Piltover purchased his maps and salaried his services as Piltover's Grandmaster Explorer. This sealed the deal on Ezreal's path in life - he would eschew the arcane arts in favor of archaeology. Since then, countless of Ezreal's adventures have been written about as romanticized stories.\n\nOne of Ezreal's latest adventures, however, has brought him face-to-face with his other legacy - his latent magical power. While exploring the pyramids of Shurima Desert, Ezreal uncovered an amulet of incredible power. Aside from the sheer size of the amulet (it was made for a being easily twice Ezreal's size), it allows the wielder to control and shape magical energy - provided a source of magic is in the vicinity. This allowed Ezreal to tap into his natural talent for magic without having to put any serious effort into it - a big win for the Prodigal Explorer. The drawback is that for some unknown reason, the amulet is attuned with summoning magic. Without warning, Ezreal may find himself acting as a champion for, as he puts it, \"a summoner hell-bent on resolving some irrelevant world-shattering League conflict.\" Still, Ezreal feels being summoned into a Field of Justice on occasion is a small price to pay.\n\n\"There's little time to study musty tomes when you're busy crawling around where the musty tomes originally came from.\" Such is Ezreal's credo."},"title":"the Prodigal Explorer","icon":"Ezreal_Square_0.png","select_sound":"en_US/Ezreal.mp3","id":81},"82":{"skins":{"0":{"portrait":"Mordekaiser_0.jpg","internal_name":"BaseMordekaiser","name":"","base":true,"splash":"Mordekaiser_Splash_0.jpg","id":82000},"1":{"portrait":"Mordekaiser_1.jpg","internal_name":"DragonMordekaiser","name":"Dragon Knight Mordekaiser","base":false,"splash":"Mordekaiser_Splash_1.jpg","id":82001},"2":{"portrait":"Mordekaiser_2.jpg","internal_name":"InfernalMordekaiser","name":"Infernal Mordekaiser","base":false,"splash":"Mordekaiser_Splash_2.jpg","id":82002},"3":{"portrait":"Mordekaiser_3.jpg","internal_name":"MetalMordekaiser","name":"Pentakill Mordekaiser","base":false,"splash":"Mordekaiser_Splash_3.jpg","id":82003},"4":{"portrait":"Mordekaiser_4.jpg","internal_name":"DestroyerMordekaiser","name":"Lord Mordekaiser","base":false,"splash":"Mordekaiser_Splash_4.jpg","id":82004},"count":5},"rating":{"magic":6,"defense":6,"attack":6,"difficulty":3},"tags":{"fighter":true,"pusher":true,"melee":true},"internal_name":"Mordekaiser","name":"Mordekaiser","abilities":[{"cost":[0,0,0,0,0],"desc":"On next hit, Mordekaiser swings his mace with such force that it echoes out, striking up to 3 additional nearby targets, dealing damage plus bonus damage.

Each gravedigger taught his son that this shovel was imbued with the spirit of every forefather, and that those spirits would protect him during the long lonely nights amongst the tombstones. To his eternal regret, Yorick died without an heir, bringing the proud Mori line to a close. His body was interred with his shovel in the family mausoleum, and the Final Rest Memorial soon fell to ruin. Death, however, was not the end Yorick had expected.\n\nYorick emerged on the haunted shores of the Shadow Isles - not quite dead, definitely not alive - still clutching his beloved shovel. He soon learned that with it he could act as a ferryman for the Isles' undead denizens, helping them climb death's many-tiered ladder. This proved a curse, as a gravedigger must \"bury his quota\" before he too can ascend, or so the legend goes. No one knows what \"his quota\" is. Yorick dug tirelessly, waiting in vain for the day when he would be freed of his burden. As decades turned to centuries, the shame of his failures came to a head. He returned to Valoran to find his corpse, convinced that salvation might be buried with it. When he arrived, no trace remained of either the mausoleum or the memorial. Hope nearly lost, he discovered the League of Legends, and there saw an opportunity to immortalize the family name he allowed to be forgotten ages ago."},"title":"the Gravedigger","icon":"Yorick_Square_0.png","select_sound":"en_US/Yorick.mp3","id":83},"84":{"skins":{"0":{"portrait":"Akali_0.jpg","internal_name":"BaseAkali","name":"","base":true,"splash":"Akali_Splash_0.jpg","id":84000},"1":{"portrait":"Akali_1.jpg","internal_name":"YellowAkali","name":"Stinger Akali","base":false,"splash":"Akali_Splash_1.jpg","id":84001},"2":{"portrait":"Akali_2.jpg","internal_name":"CrimsonAkali","name":"Crimson Akali","base":false,"splash":"Akali_Splash_2.jpg","id":84002},"3":{"portrait":"Akali_3.jpg","internal_name":"SoccerAkali","name":"All-star Akali","base":false,"splash":"Akali_Splash_3.jpg","id":84003},"4":{"portrait":"Akali_4.jpg","internal_name":"NurseAkali","name":"Nurse Akali","base":false,"splash":"Akali_Splash_4.jpg","id":84004},"5":{"portrait":"Akali_5.jpg","internal_name":"OniAkali","name":"Blood Moon Akali","base":false,"splash":"Akali_Splash_5.jpg","id":84005},"6":{"portrait":"Akali_6.jpg","internal_name":"mercenaryAkali","name":"Silverfang Akali","base":false,"splash":"Akali_Splash_6.jpg","id":84006},"count":7},"rating":{"magic":8,"defense":3,"attack":5,"difficulty":6},"tags":{"stealth":true,"melee":true,"assassin":true},"internal_name":"Akali","name":"Akali","abilities":[{"cost":[60.0,60.0,60.0,60.0,60.0],"desc":"Akali spins her kama at a target enemy to deal magic damage and mark the target for 6 seconds.

According to legend, the Solari were formed by a warrior who could call the raw might of the sun down upon his enemies in combat.  He claimed Mount Targon's summit, the point on Valoran closest to the sun, for his solar devotion, a tradition which generations of Solari have preserved to this day.\n\nLeona's parents were traditional Rakkorans, both bred for the heat of battle.  To them, Leona was a problem child.  She was capable of fighting as fiercely as any other -- including her childhood friend, Pantheon -- but she did not share their zeal for killing.  She believed that the true worth of a soldier lay in her ability to defend and protect.  When it came time for her Rite of Kor, a ceremony in which two Rakkoran teens battle to the death for the right to bear a relic-weapon, Leona refused to fight.  For this, the Rakkoran leaders ordered her execution, but when they tried to strike the fatal blow, sunlight burst forth, bathing Mount Targon in light.  As it faded, Leona stood unharmed and her executioners lay unconscious around her.  The Solari immediately claimed Leona, demanding that her sentence be repealed.

The General offered Talon the choice between death at his hand, or life as an agent of the Noxian High Command. Talon chose life, on the condition that his service was to Du Couteau alone, for the only type of orders he could respect were from one he could not defeat.

This baleful beacon's gentle flicker -- now fastened to Runeterra -- drew forth a putrid beast that ambled across a threshold it did not understand, widening a fissure between the spaces which were never meant to meet. There amongst the haunting ruins of Icathia, Kog'Maw manifested in Valoran with unsettling curiosity. The spark which led him to Runeterra teased him still, urging him gently towards Malzahar. It also encouraged him to familiarize himself with his new environment, to the stark horror of everything he encountered on his journey.\n\nThe enchanting colors and aromas of Runeterra intoxicated Kog'Maw, and he explored the fruits of the strange world the only way he knew how: by devouring them. At first he sampled only the wild flora and fauna he happened across. As he traversed the parched Tempest Flats, however, he came upon a tribe of nomads. Seemingly unhampered by conventional rules of physics, Kog'Maw consumed every nomad and any obstacles they put in his way, amounting to many times his own mass and volume.

Such magic was beyond the limitations of a mortal body, but Xerath obsessively pursued a path to infinite power nonetheless. With every breakthrough he grew more and more powerful, yet not without consequence. Xerath's increasing arcane abilities wrought havoc on his physical form. Desperate, he undertook a dangerous ritual to transcend his dying body. The outcome would be immortality or self-destruction. Violent magic unleashed during the ritual caused devastation throughout Shurima, but when the dust settled, Xerath emerged as an ascended being of pure arcane energy.\n\nFree of flesh and bone, Xerath held nearly infinite power at his command. However, in the wake of his chaotic ritual, the mages of Shurima feared his careless disregard for life would bring ruin to the kingdom. After a terrible struggle they subdued Xerath, but they could not destroy his ascended form. Instead they trapped him within an enchanted sarcophagus and sealed him in an underground tomb. Eons passed, civilizations rose and fell, and Xerath's imprisonment was lost to memory. For centuries, Xerath's vast power tore away at the sarcophagus and weakened its spell. Finally, he willed forth a burst of magic that shattered his prison, but its core remained, containing Xerath and his power within its broken pieces. Seeking to rid himself of this burden, he was drawn to the magic of Valoran's nexuses and found he could absorb their power. Yet the nexuses had gatekeepers: petty mages known as summoners. Xerath knew his key to true freedom from his prison lay in gaining their trust, and he offered his power to the League of Legends."},"title":"the Magus Ascendant","icon":"Xerath_Square_0.png","select_sound":"en_US/Xerath.mp3","id":101},"102":{"skins":{"0":{"portrait":"Shyvana_0.jpg","internal_name":"BaseShyvana","name":"","base":true,"splash":"Shyvana_Splash_0.jpg","id":102000},"1":{"portrait":"Shyvana_1.jpg","internal_name":"KnightShyvana","name":"Ironscale Shyvana","base":false,"splash":"Shyvana_Splash_1.jpg","id":102001},"2":{"portrait":"Shyvana_2.jpg","internal_name":"BoneShyvana","name":"Boneclaw Shyvana","base":false,"splash":"Shyvana_Splash_2.jpg","id":102002},"3":{"portrait":"Shyvana_3.jpg","internal_name":"ShadowShyvana","name":"Darkflame Shyvana","base":false,"splash":"Shyvana_Splash_3.jpg","id":102003},"count":4},"rating":{"magic":5,"defense":6,"attack":7,"difficulty":4},"tags":{"fighter":true,"melee":true},"internal_name":"Shyvana","name":"Shyvana","abilities":[{"cost":[0,0,0,0,0],"desc":"Shyvana strikes twice on her next attack.<br><br><font color='#FF3300'>Dragon Form: </font>Twin Bite cleaves all units in front Shyvana.","cooldown":[10.0,9.0,8.0,7.0,6.0],"tooltip_values":{"@Effect1Amount@":[80.0,85.0,90.0,95.0,100.0],"@CharAbilityPower@":1.0},"tooltip":"Shyvana strikes twice on her next attack, dealing (+@f1@) physical damage on the second attack.

He introduced himself as Jarvan IV, the Prince of Demacia, and offered to aid Shyvana in her quest for vengeance. Together they hunted down and confronted the vicious dragon that had slain her father. Shyvana did not expect the men to survive, but in the clash of fire and steel, Jarvan and his men fought with strength she had never believed humans to possess. The ironclad warriors drove their foe into submission, and Shyvana struck the final blow, tearing the beast's heart from its body.

Fizz, however, harbored a curious spirit that could not be satisfied living so cushioned a life.

One day, Fizz returned to find the city abandoned: his people had vanished, leaving Fizz without a clue to explain their disappearance. With nothing left in the city to keep him, Fizz salvaged an enchanted trident from the ruins and set out alone.\n\nFor years, Fizz wandered the ocean, using the skills he'd learned during his adventures as a young boy to survive. Finally, Fizz discovered the port of Bilgewater. He was fascinated with the existence of life above the water and could not resist exploring the island. In his endless curiosity, Fizz inadverently meddled in the affairs of the humans who lived there and his presence did not go unnoticed. His mischief angered many residents who eventually sought to capture or kill him. Fizz found himself cornered, and he prepared to return to the sea despite the fondness he'd come to hold for Bilgewater. As he stood at the docks, a massive dragon-shark attacked the port.

When his brother was killed during a hunt on the tundra, the tribe looked to Volibear as his successor.

This expedition took him deep into unknown waters where he and his crew found a vast section of black oozing liquid that none of the crew could identify. Though their job was to investigate anything new that they found, no man aboard was willing to brave the murk except Nautilus. Only moments after he donned the hulking diver's suit and climbed over the ship's rail, something lurking in the muck grabbed hold of him. He clung to the side of the ship, but the thing below pulled him fiercely, rocking the entire ship. The other sailors grew afraid and made a terrible decision. As he stared and pled for help, they wrenched his grip free of the rail. He tumbled into the ink, grabbing the anchor in futile desperation. Dark tendrils enveloped him and he could do nothing but watch as the dimming outline of his ship faded away. Then everything went black.\n\nWhen Nautilus awoke, he was something... different. The great iron suit had become a seamless shell around him, concealing whatever awful truth lay inside. All the details of his memory seemed fuzzy and indistinct but one fact remained clear: he was left here, alone in the sunless depths, to die. In his hands he still clutched the anchor that belonged to the men who had condemned him. Having no other purpose, he took this clue and trudged - too heavy to swim or run - in search of answers. He wandered without direction or sense of passing time in what felt like an eternal dream. By the time he stumbled upon the shores of Bilgewater, he could find no traces of the man he was. No house, no family, no life to which he could return. Terrified sailors who'd heard his tale directed Nautilus back to the Institute, but the summoners refused to relinquish the names of the others they commissioned. By then Nautilus had learned about the League of Legends and there he saw an opportunity to discover and punish those responsible for the time and life he lost."},"title":"the Titan of the Depths","icon":"Nautilus_Square_0.png","select_sound":"en_US/Nautilus.mp3","id":111},"112":{"skins":{"0":{"portrait":"Viktor_0.jpg","internal_name":"BaseViktor","name":"","base":true,"splash":"Viktor_Splash_0.jpg","id":112000},"1":{"portrait":"Viktor_1.jpg","internal_name":"Viktor_fullmachine","name":"Full Machine Viktor","base":false,"splash":"Viktor_Splash_1.jpg","id":112001},"2":{"portrait":"Viktor_2.jpg","internal_name":"Viktor_prototype","name":"Prototype Viktor","base":false,"splash":"Viktor_Splash_2.jpg","id":112002},"count":3},"rating":{"magic":8,"defense":5,"attack":2,"difficulty":7},"tags":{"pusher":true,"mage":true,"ranged":true},"internal_name":"Viktor","name":"Viktor","abilities":[{"cost":[45.0,50.0,55.0,60.0,65.0],"desc":"Viktor blasts an enemy unit dealing magic damage, returning a portion of the damage dealt as a shield.","cooldown":[9.0,8.0,7.0,6.0,5.0],"tooltip_values":{"@Effect1Amount@":[80.0,125.0,170.0,215.0,260.0],"@CharAbilityPower@":0.64999997615814209,"@Effect4Amount@":[128,0,0,0,0]},"tooltip":"Viktor blasts an enemy unit for @Effect1Amount@ (+@CharAbilityPower@) magic damage, returning @Effect4Amount@ (+@CharAbilityPower2@) as a shield.","name":"Power Transfer"},{"cost":[65.0,65.0,65.0,65.0,65.0],"desc":"Viktor conjures a heavy gravitational field that slows any target in its radius.

Viktor's appeals for justice fell on deaf ears, and he sank into a deep depression.  He withdrew from the College and barricaded himself in his private laboratory, cutting all human ties.  There, in secret, he conceived a project for which nobody else could claim credit.  Desiring both to revolutionize his field and to eliminate the jealous human emotions which festered inside him, he engineered parts to replace and improve his own body.\n\nWhen Viktor re-emerged, almost no trace of the original man remained.  Not only had he supplanted the majority of his anatomy, but his personality had changed.  His previous hope to better society was replaced by an obsession with what he called \"the glorious evolution.\"  He saw himself as the patron and pioneer of Valoran's future - a future in which man would renounce his flesh in favor of superior hextech augmentations.  Though Viktor's initial appeals were met with heavy skepticism, scientists were confounded by the sophistication of his machinery.  By integrating his mind with techmaturgical devices, he had been able to drastically accelerate the progress of his research.

Aspiring to be a revered inventor like Heimerdinger, he rattled through ambitious projects with manic zeal, emboldened by both his explosive failures and his unprecedented discoveries. Word of Ziggs' volatile experimentation reached the famed Yordle Academy in Piltover and its esteemed professors invited him to demonstrate his craft. His characteristic disregard for safety brought the presentation to an early conclusion, however, when the hextech engine Ziggs was demonstrating overheated and exploded, blowing a huge hole in the wall of the Academy. The professors dusted themselves off and sternly motioned for him to leave. Devastated, Ziggs prepared to return to Bandle City in shame. However, before he could leave, a group of Zaunite agents infiltrated the Academy and kidnapped the professors. The Piltover military tracked the captives to a Zaunite prison, but their weapons were incapable of destroying the fortified walls. Determined to outdo them, Ziggs began experimenting on a new kind of armament, and quickly realized that he could harness his accidental gift for demolition to save the captured yordles.\n\nBefore long, Ziggs had created a line of powerful bombs he lovingly dubbed \"hexplosives.\" With his new creations ready for their first trial, Ziggs traveled to Zaun and sneaked into the prison compound. He launched a gigantic bomb at the prison and watched with glee as the explosion tore through the reinforced wall. Once the smoke had cleared, Ziggs scuttled into the facility, sending guards running with a hail of bombs. He rushed to the cell, blew the door off its hinges, and led the captive yordles to freedom. Upon returning to the Academy, the humbled professors recognized Ziggs with an honorary title - Dean of Demolitions - and proposed that he demonstrate this new form of yordle ingenuity in the League of Legends. Vindicated at last, Ziggs accepted the proposal, eager to bring his ever-expanding range of hexplosives to the greatest testing grounds in the world: the Fields of Justice."},"title":"the Hexplosives Expert","icon":"Ziggs_Square_0.png","select_sound":"en_US/Ziggs.mp3","id":115},"117":{"skins":{"0":{"portrait":"Lulu_0.jpg","internal_name":"BaseLulu","name":"","base":true,"splash":"Lulu_Splash_0.jpg","id":117000},"1":{"portrait":"Lulu_1.jpg","internal_name":"luluDarkCandy","name":"Bittersweet Lulu","base":false,"splash":"Lulu_Splash_1.jpg","id":117001},"2":{"portrait":"Lulu_2.jpg","internal_name":"luluClassic","name":"Wicked Lulu","base":false,"splash":"Lulu_Splash_2.jpg","id":117002},"3":{"portrait":"Lulu_3.jpg","internal_name":"luluDragonTrainer","name":"Dragon Trainer Lulu","base":false,"splash":"Lulu_Splash_3.jpg","id":117003},"count":4},"rating":{"magic":7,"defense":5,"attack":4,"difficulty":5},"tags":{"support":true,"ranged":true},"internal_name":"Lulu","name":"Lulu","abilities":[{"cost":[40.0,50.0,60.0,70.0,80.0],"desc":"Pix and Lulu each fire a bolt of magical energy that heavily slows all enemies it hits.

It wasn't that she was antisocial; the day-to-day bustle of Bandle City just couldn't compete with the vibrant world of her imagination. She saw wonder in places most people overlooked. This was how she found Pix, a fae spirit, pretending to be stuck in a birdhouse. Lulu's imagination distinguished her to Pix and he seized the opportunity to lure her into his world. He brought her to the Glade, the enchanted home of the fae, which lay nestled in a clearing in the woods. There the rigid properties of the outside world - things like size and color - changed as frequently and whimsically as the direction of the wind. Lulu felt at home in the Glade and she lingered there with Pix, fascinated by this secret place.\n\nShe quickly lost track of time. Her life in the Glade was comfortable and natural. She and Pix played fae games together, the sorts of games that she had been told were \"make believe\"... and she got exceedingly good at them. It caught her by surprise when she suddenly remembered that she had left a life behind in Bandle City. The Glade had a way of making everything outside seem distant and surreal. Lulu decided to revisit her former home, to share some of the lovely things she'd learned, but when she and Pix returned the world had changed. Time, she discovered, was another property that behaved differently in the Glade, and centuries had passed while she was away. Lulu sought to reconnect to the residents of the outside world but her attempts had unfortunate results. She led all the children off to play hide and seek, temporarily changing them into flowers and animals to spice up the game, but their parents didn't appreciate her efforts.

No one had ever seen anything like his titanic, ethereal form before, and the mystery of his sudden arrival was deeply unnerving. When Hecarim began to march eastwards, leaving a trail of desolate, lifeless ground behind him, the villagers of the plains fled their homes for the safety of nearby Demacia. In the city's now-overcrowded taverns, rumors about this inhuman phantom spread in hushed whispers. Some claimed that he was the vengeful shade of an ancient warrior, intent on destroying all living beings; one man insisted that they had seen him leading an entire legion of spectral cavalrymen; others still believed him to be the creation of some hateful necromancer. One Demacian commander, seeking to dispel the terror that had gripped the city, assembled a few of his finest soldiers and rode out to turn back or destroy Hecarim.\n\nThe commander led his soldiers to stand in Hecarim's path and braced for his assault. As the apparition bore down on them, an overwhelming sensation of dread gripped the warriors. The men, frozen in fear, could only scream as the ghostly titan ran them down, tearing them apart and trampling them beneath his iron hooves. Hecarim turned to the crippled, cowering commander and uttered a chilling statement: \"This is merely the beginning. No mortal army can withstand the might of the Shadow Isles.\" With that, Hecarim departed, resuming his grim march. Driven to insanity by his nightmarish experience, the commander stumbled back to Demacia, where his dire warnings were dismissed as the ravings of a madman. While Hecarim's origin and intent were still a mystery, his destination became clear when he reached the Institute of War and, in a voice both ominous and commanding, demanded entry into the League of Legends."},"title":"the Shadow of War","icon":"Hecarim_Square_0.png","select_sound":"en_US/Hecarim.mp3","id":120},"121":{"skins":{"0":{"portrait":"Khazix_0.jpg","internal_name":"BaseKhazix","name":"","base":true,"splash":"Khazix_Splash_0.jpg","id":121000},"1":{"portrait":"Khazix_1.jpg","internal_name":"KhazixDroid","name":"Mecha Kha'Zix","base":false,"splash":"Khazix_Splash_1.jpg","id":121001},"count":2},"rating":{"magic":6,"defense":4,"attack":9,"difficulty":7},"tags":{"stealth":true,"melee":true,"assassin":true,"jungler":true},"internal_name":"Khazix","name":"Kha'Zix","abilities":[{"cost":[25.0,25.0,25.0,25.0,25.0],"desc":"Kha'Zix passively marks enemies that are isolated from nearby allies.

Eager to make a name for himself, he began developing a device to harness its power. Word of the crystal's potential reached beyond the borders of Piltover.

She now presents her foes with a terrible ultimatum: revere the moon's light, or die by her crescent blade.\n\nThough she was born to the Solari, Diana's inquisitive nature set her apart from her brethren. She had always found solace and guidance in the night sky, and questioned the dominance of the sun in her society. The Solari elders responded to her challenges with only derision and punishment. Diana remained convinced, however, that if she could find evidence of the moon's power, the elders would listen to reason. For years, she studied Solari archives in solitude until she discovered an encoded message hidden in an old tome. This clue led her to a secluded valley on Mount Targon where she unearthed the hidden entrance to an ancient, sealed temple. Inside, among aging relics and faded murals, she found an ornate suit of armor and a beautiful crescent blade, both inscribed with sigils of the moon. Diana donned the armaments and returned to the Solari elders that night. She declared that the artifacts proved others had once worshipped the moon as she did. Her discovery of evidence challenging Solari dominion shocked the elders. To Diana's horror, they pronounced her a heretic and condemned her to death. As the elders prepared her for execution, Diana's anger and sorrow overwhelmed her desire for acceptance. She lifted her gaze to the sky, calling upon the moon for strength. Lunar power surged within her and she shattered her bindings. Raising her relic blade, she turned and slaughtered the elders.

The pair's unbreakable bond is deadly on the battlefield, leaving opponents blind and riddled with arrows long before they realize who they're fighting: not one, but two Demacian legends.\n\nAs a young girl, Quinn shared a hunger for adventure with her twin brother. They dreamed of becoming knights, but lived a quiet, humble life in the rural borderlands of Demacia. Together they imagined triumphant battles in faraway lands, seizing glory for their king and slaying foes in the name of Demacian justice. When daydreams alone could no longer satisfy their warriors souls, they embarked on daring wilderness adventures in search of true danger. One such quest turned to tragedy when a terrible accident claimed her brother's life. Overcome with grief, Quinn abandoned her dreams of knighthood. \n\nOn the anniversary of her loss, Quinn gathered the courage to return to the scene of the tragedy. To her surprise, she found a wounded Demacian eagle at the site of her brother's death - a rare and beautiful bird long believed extinct. Quinn nursed the fledgling back to health, and as they grew up together, a deep bond formed between the two. She saw the same quality in her newfound friend that had lived within her brother, and so she gave him the name \"Valor.\" The pair found strength in each other, and together they pursued the dream she had once abandoned. \n\nThe Demacian army had never seen heroes like Quinn and Valor. Their deadly skills quickly set them apart from their rank-and-file peers, but many still had their doubts. How could a common-born girl, even with such a powerful creature at her side, forego years of military training? Quinn and Valor proved themselves on one critical mission, tracking down a Noxian assassin who had evaded an entire Demacian battalion. When they brought him to justice, they finally earned the admiration and respect of their nation. The two now serve as living, fighting icons of Demacian strength and perseverance.

She thought she would perish alone, until the appearance of an unwary sorceress presented her with an opportunity for salvation.\n\nIt was the first time in years Zyra had sensed a creature wander so close. Hunger drew her to the sorceress, but some other, deeper instinct compelled her. She enveloped the woman in thorns with ease, but as she savored this final meal, foreign memories invaded her thoughts. She saw great jungles of metal and stone where humans and animals thrived. Potent magic surged through her vines, and she devised an elegant but risky plan to survive. Using the woman's memories, Zyra poured her newfound magic into the creation of a human-shaped vessel. She didn't know what sort of world awaited her, but she had nothing left to lose. When Zyra opened her eyes, she was overwhelmed by the raw power ready at her fingertips.

He defied his clan and master, casting off the balance and discipline that had shackled him all his life. Zed now offers power to those who embrace knowledge of the shadows, and slays those who cling to ignorance.\n\nAn orphan, Zed was taken in and trained by a great ninja master. Only one other student appeared to be Zed's equal - the master's son, Shen. It seemed Zed could never win the favor of the master, as every match between the rivals ended in a draw. Frustrated and jealous, he sought an advantage. The young ninja ventured into a sealed part of the clan's temple, where he found an ornate, foreboding box. Sensing the dark knowledge within, Zed knew he should not open it, but he peered inside nonetheless. In an instant, shadows touched his mind, revealing techniques that had long been hidden. Now armed with a secret edge, he challenged Shen, and this time he defeated the master's son. He expected praise and recognition in his moment of victory, but somehow the master knew Zed had used forbidden ways, and banished him.\n\nHumiliated, the young ninja wandered for years. His bitterness turned to ambition, and he began to train others in the style of the shadows. As his power grew, so did his circle of followers, but he knew that without the box, his technique would never be perfect. One day, Zed looked at his followers and saw that his students were now an army. He led them back to the temple to claim his prize. At the gates, he was surprised to find the old master waiting, receiving Zed and his disciples as if they were welcome guests. The old man laid his sword at Zed's feet, declaring that he had failed Zed as his master. By banishing his former student, the master had doomed Zed to the shadows, instead of leading him to the balanced path. The old man implored Zed to enter the temple, destroy the box, and lead his followers to balance. The dark ninja followed the master inside. Moments later, the assembled ninjas heard Zed cry out in pain. Mysteriously, he emerged unscathed, and threw the severed head of the master at Shen's feet. Screaming in rage, Zed commanded his followers to slaughter the master's students and seize the box.\n\nThat day, the old ninja order fell. Though many students died, some escaped thanks to Shen's heroic efforts. Now the temple is a dark training ground for the Order of the Shadow. Zed rules as the Order's master, and his edict is simple: perfect one's technique, and kill all ninjas who refuse to embrace the shadows."},"title":"the Master of Shadows","icon":"Zed_Square_0.png","select_sound":"en_US/Zed.mp3","id":238},"254":{"skins":{"0":{"portrait":"Vi_0.jpg","internal_name":"BaseVi","name":"","base":true,"splash":"Vi_Splash_0.jpg","id":254000},"1":{"portrait":"Vi_1.jpg","internal_name":"ViRacer","name":"Neon Strike Vi","base":false,"splash":"Vi_Splash_1.jpg","id":254001},"count":2},"rating":{"magic":3,"defense":5,"attack":8,"difficulty":5},"tags":{"fighter":true,"melee":true},"internal_name":"Vi","name":"Vi","abilities":[{"cost":[50.0,60.0,70.0,80.0,90.0],"desc":"Vi charges her gauntlets and unleashes a vault shattering punch, carrying her forward.

Though she grew up on the wrong side of the law, Vi now uses her criminal know-how to serve Piltover's police force. Vi's brash attitude, abrasive humor, and blatant refusal to follow orders can often infuriate her by-the-books partner, Caitlyn. But even the sheriff of Piltover cannot deny that Vi is an invaluable asset in the fight against crime.\n\nAs a child growing up in the lawless outskirts of Piltover, Vi learned to rob and cheat to get by. Stealing and stripping hextech hardware gave her the skills of a master mechanic, while life on the streets taught her self-reliance. When she was six, a ragtag group of criminals took a shine to the young delinquent and brought her into their fold. By the time Vi was eleven, she had become a seasoned accomplice, and she relished the thrill of every heist.\n\nVi's attitude changed when a raid on a mining facility went bad. She was forced to decide between fleeing with her crew and trying to save the innocent mine workers from a collapsed tunnel. Vi chose to play the hero. While searching for a way to free the mine workers from the rubble, she discovered a damaged robotic mining rig. Improvising, she wrenched off its huge fists and modified them into makeshift hextech gauntlets. Fitting the heavy weapons to her tiny hands, the young girl flexed her arm and threw a powered punch at the rubble. The force of the blow blasted away the rock. With the workers free to escape, Vi fled the scene.\n\nAfter that job gone wrong, Vi severed her connection to the crew. She returned to a life of solitary crime, but stole only from other criminals. As the years went by, Vi modified and improved her hextech fists, allowing her to bust up heists and snatch loot with ease. Eventually, word of her notoriety reached Caitlyn, the famed Sheriff of Piltover. Rather than seek Vi's arrest, Caitlyn offered the criminal a way to pay her debt to society: work for the law in Piltover. Vi laughed. To her, a job that let her beat up crooks without forcing her to run from the cops sounded perfect. She immediately accepted. Caitlyn now struggles to keep Vi in line, and Vi treats Caitlyn's orders as mere suggestions, but when they work together, they are feared by all lawbreakers in Piltover."},"title":"the Piltover Enforcer","icon":"Vi_Square_0.png","select_sound":"en_US/Vi.mp3","id":254},"267":{"skins":{"0":{"portrait":"Nami_0.jpg","internal_name":"BaseNami","name":"","base":true,"splash":"Nami_Splash_0.jpg","id":267000},"1":{"portrait":"Nami_1.jpg","internal_name":"NamiKoi","name":"Koi Nami","base":false,"splash":"Nami_Splash_1.jpg","id":267001},"count":2},"rating":{"magic":8,"defense":4,"attack":3,"difficulty":7},"tags":{"support":true,"ranged":true},"internal_name":"Nami","name":"Nami","abilities":[{"cost":[60.0,60.0,60.0,60.0,60.0],"desc":"Sends a bubble towards a targeted area, dealing damage and stunning all enemies on impact.","cooldown":[14.0,13.0,12.0,11.0,10.0],"tooltip_values":{"@Effect1Amount@":[75.0,130.0,185.0,240.0,295.0],"@CharAbilityPower@":0.64999997615814209,"@Effect2Amount@":[1.25,1.25,1.25,1.25,1.25]},"tooltip":"Sends a bubble towards a targeted area, dealing @Effect1Amount@ (+@CharAbilityPower@) magic damage to enemies, and stunning them for @Effect2Amount@ seconds.","name":"Aqua Prison"},{"cost":[70.0,85.0,100.0,115.0,130.0],"desc":"Unleashes a stream of water that bounces back and forth between allies and enemies, healing allies and damaging enemies.","cooldown":[9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0],"tooltip_values":{"@Effect1Amount@":[70.0,110.0,150.0,190.0,230.0],"@CharAbilityPower@":0.5,"@Effect2Amount@":[3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0],"@Effect3Amount@":[65.0,95.0,125.0,155.0,185.0]},"tooltip":"Unleashes a stream of water that bounces back and forth between allies and enemies.\n\nOn Ally Hit: Heals @Effect3Amount@ (+@CharAbilityPower2@) health and will bounce to a nearby enemy champion.\n\nOn Enemy Hit: Deals @Effect1Amount@ (+@CharAbilityPower@) magic damage and bounces to a nearby allied champion.\n\nBounces to each target only once, and hits up to @Effect2Amount@ targets.

Her people, the Marai, rely on the moonstone's light to ward off the terrors of the depths. However, the stone's power lasts only one hundred years. Before its light fades, the Tidecaller must journey into the Great Deep, retrieve an abyssal pearl, and carry it to the surface. There, on the night of the winter solstice of the hundredth year, the Tidecaller makes a ceremonial exchange with a landwalker bearing a moonstone. By trading the pearl for the moonstone, the Tidecaller ensures the survival of the Marai for another century.\n\nHowever, in Nami's time, as the hundred years drew to a close, no Tidecaller had been found. Without a chosen one to complete the quest, her people would face disaster, but the Marai waited in faith that the Tidecaller would appear. Nami refused to sit idle, insisting that without a Tidecaller to save them, someone had to act. Bravely, she decided to begin the quest herself and ventured alone into the dangerous depths. None expected her to survive, but after six days of battles with untold horrors, Nami returned with the pearl in hand. The Marai hailed her as the new Tidecaller. All that remained was for Nami to journey to the surface and complete the exchange.\n\nWhen Nami arrived at the surface, however, she found only an empty shore. She waited for days in a mystic cove, unsure of what to do. In all the legends of the Tidecallers, the bearer of the moonstone had never failed to arrive. Nami faced a choice.

A moment's hesitation at the sight of his ghostly visage and there is no escape. He leaves in his wake hollow corpses, their souls ripped loose and trapped in the sickly green light of his lantern. The Chain Warden takes sadistic joy in tormenting his victims, both before and after their deaths. His grim task is never complete, and he stalks the land for ever more resolute spirits to unravel.\n\nThresh carves careful, deliberate paths through Valoran. He handpicks his targets individually, devoting his full attention to each soul in turn. He isolates and toys with them, gradually eroding their sanity with his twisted, maddening humor. Once Thresh takes an interest in a soul, he does not relent until he possesses it. He then drags those he captures back to the Shadow Isles for an unimaginably dreadful fate. This is his only purpose.\n\nLittle is known about the Chain Warden's past, and many of the details live only in nursery rhymes and campfire tales. They tell of a sadistic jailer from centuries past who took great delight in torturing his wards. Patient and brutal, he used a variety of methods to break his victims' minds before their bodies succumbed to his grisly designs. Chains were the jailer's preferred instruments of terror. Their shrill scrape marked his dreadful approach and promised agony to those he visited. His dark reign went unchallenged until his prisoners escaped during a massive riot. They overwhelmed him, and without ceremony or remorse, hanged him from his own chains. Thus began the unlife of the horrible specter known as Thresh, or so the tales go.\n\nThresh now haunts the land, leaving an aftermath of horror and despair. However, there is a devious purpose behind his dark machinations, and the meager spirits of average men are insufficient. He seeks stronger souls. Only when he has broken the wills of Valoran's most resilient warriors will he finally have what he needs."},"title":"the Chain Warden","icon":"Thresh_Square_0.png","select_sound":"en_US/Thresh.mp3","id":412}}}
