    lore: {desc: 'In the time shortly before the League, there were those within the
        sinister city-state of Noxus who did not agree with the evils perpetrated
        by the Noxian High Command. The High Command had just put down a coup attempt
        from the self-proclaimed Crown Prince Raschallion, and a crack down on any
        form of dissent against the new government was underway. These political and
        social outcasts, known as the Gray Order, sought to leave their neighbors
        in peace as they pursued dark arcane knowledge. The leaders of this outcast
        society were a married couple: Gregori Hastur, the Gray Warlock, and his wife
        Amoline, the Shadow Witch. Together they led an exodus of magicians and other
        intelligentsia from Noxus, resettling their followers beyond the Great Barrier
        to the northern reaches of the unforgiving Voodoo Lands. Though survival was
        a challenge at times, the Gray Order''s colony managed to thrive in a land
        where so many others would have failed.


        Years after the exodus, Gregori and Amoline had a child: Annie. Early on,
        Annie''s parents knew there was something special about their daughter. At
        the age of two, Annie miraculously ensorcelled a shadow bear - a ferocious
        denizen of the petrified forests outside the colony - turning it into her
        pet. To this day she keeps her bear "Tibbers" by her side, often keeping him
        spellbound as a stuffed doll to be carried like a child''s toy. The combination
        of Annie''s lineage and the dark magic of her birthplace have given this little
        girl tremendous arcane power. It is this same girl who now finds herself as
        one of the most sought-after champions within the League of Legends - even
        by the city-state that would have exiled her parents had they not fled beforehand.',
      quote: Annie may be one of the most powerful champions ever to have fought in
        a Field of Justice. I shudder to think of her capabilities when she becomes
        an adult., quote_author: High Councilor Kiersta Mandrake}

    lore: {desc: 'On an uncharted continent beyond Valoran''s grasping clutches, the
        conqueror named Olaf was born to a long tradition of soldiers unlike most
        others.  Berserkers, as they tout themselves, are warriors who channel fury
        deep from their cores, unleashing pure and savage wrath upon their enemies.  This
        fearsome evolution is a product of their unforgiving home, Lokfar - a barren
        tundra where all creatures must vie bitterly for every resource.  Olaf belonged
        to a seafaring clan known for ruthlessly pillaging any and all villages within
        reach of their dragon-crested longboats.  The last time he saw his icy home,
        Olaf was embarking on an expedition to pioneer and plunder a distant land
        known only to legend.  However, while underway, a terrible storm sprung up
        and Olaf and his crew were thrown to the mercy of a roiling and pitiless sea.


        His ship destroyed, his crew nowhere to be found, Olaf miraculously washed
        up untold miles from "friendly" waters on the foreign shores of Valoran, south
        of Demacia.  This unfamiliar place stunned and frightened the Berserker, for
        Lokfar is not privy to such potent magicians.  Approaching them, Olaf hoped
        that they could use their mysterious powers to send him back to his people.  A
        bargain was struck.  Olaf would use his awesome prowess as a warrior to serve
        the unusual wars of Valoran in the League of Legends, and in exchange the
        sorcerers would find him a way to return.  Despite his participation in the
        League, Olaf knows better than to trust the "finger wagglers" that run the
        Institute of War.  He deliberately keeps details of his life and home from
        them.  After all, with enough information, they would most certainly find
        the Lokfarians and dominate them as they have dominated all of Valoran, keeping
        both quietly -- and unwittingly -- in their thrall.


        Beware the war cry of the Berserker.  What surges toward you is unyielding,
        free from the shackles of reason.', quote: '', quote_author: ''}

    lore: {desc: 'Long before the League''s regulation of such magic, mages experimented
        with the creation of artificial life.  Now forbidden, instilling golems with
        reason was once not so uncommon a practice amongst the more expert of craftsmen.  One
        such visionary was the Demacian artificer, Durand.  Peerless at crafting sentient
        beings, Durand''s constructs served as tireless guardians for the border towns
        of his beloved city-state, affording them protection from their Noxian neighbors.  For
        his own defense, however, Durand kept his magnum opus: Galio.  This mighty
        construct - forged in the image of a gargoyle - kept him safe on his journeys,
        allowing him to perform his important work without fear of reprisal from those
        hostile to his homeland.  That is, until dealing with his taxing sentinels
        finally roused the ire of the Noxian High Command.


        As Durand crossed the Howling Marsh with his masterwork in tow, he was set
        upon by Noxian assassins in force.  Outnumbered and overwhelmed, Galio looked
        on in horror as the murderers cut down his charge, executing him swiftly before
        vanishing back into the mists.  Stripped of his reason for being, Galio despaired.  For
        years he remained in solitude, standing vigil over the bones of the master
        he had failed to protect... a literal monument to his own everlasting shame.  Then,
        one nondescript day, a sad but determined yordle girl carrying a mighty Demacian
        crown stopped in the shadow of a great statue to rest.  Hidden in plain sight
        from his unsuspecting visitor, Galio studied the forlorn yordle.  She looked
        as though she too shouldered a tremendous burden.  As quietly and as stoically
        as she had arrived, she departed in the direction of Demacia.  This encounter
        lit a spark in Galio''s eye.  Remembering the cause that his master had died
        defending, Galio arose from his silent purgatory and followed in the wake
        of this brave creature.  He had a new reason to live: to join the League of
        Legends and fight for the will of Demacia.', quote: There is no such thing

    lore: {desc: 'Although born to poor gypsy parents, the champion known as Twisted
        Fate was able to gamble his way to prosperity as a card shark in the seedy
        underground gambling circuits of Demacia and Noxus.  No matter how close the
        authorities came to catching him, the rogue always found a way to slip through
        their fingers.  Despite his good fortune, he was never able to win that which
        he truly desired - the ability to control magic.  When Twisted Fate learned
        of an experiment being conducted in Zaun that might help him with his wish,
        he did the only thing a gambler of his worth could do - he went all in and
        volunteered for the experiment.


        Conducted by the infamous Dr. Xavier Rath, Twisted Fate was told that the
        wager for such participation might be steep.  He might change forever, or
        nothing might happen, or he might die horribly.  Pain, however, was likely
        a part of the deal no matter the outcome. These were hardly the worst odds
        the gambler had faced; his hopes raised, Twisted Fate underwent the experiment,
        enduring what he must for a chance at his dream.  Then, it ended - with seemingly
        no effect whatsoever.  The gypsy rogue flew into a murderous rage, but, before
        he could strike down the team, he suddenly teleported himself miles away.  With
        a sly grin, he realized his luck had won out yet again. He now brings his
        luck and rakish charm to the Institute of War, where he is the Champion of
        choice for many - especially the gambling kind.  To this day, Twisted Fate
        has avoided his inevitable reunion with Dr. Rath.  The Card Master knows,
        however, that a confrontation is coming.


        While the future may be mysterious and unknown to most, Twisted Fate is certain
        that his future lies within the cards.', quote: '', quote_author: ''}

    lore: {desc: 'Whenever Jarvan III, the king of Demacia, delivers one of his rallying
        speeches from the glinting marble balcony atop the Royal Palace, Xin Zhao
        is at his side. Coined the Seneschal of Demacia, Xin Zhao is the personal
        steward of the Lightshield Dynasty. His enigmatic, silent vigil has led to
        an abundance of conjecture concerning his "secret life" and origins. Whether
        it''s "Zaun double-agent" tendered at the dinner table or "indebted rune mage"
        mused in the editorials of the "Demacian Constant", Xin Zhao betrays no hints
        to sate the curiosity of the masses... for good reason.


        Prior to the formation of the League, Noxus was renowned for a spectacle called
        The Fleshing. It was a gladiatorial event with a cruel twist: as a fighter
        won matches, his number of opponents (generally prisoners of war) fought simultaneously
        would increase. This meant eventual death for every contender, but with unparalleled
        glory. Xin Zhao, known then as Viscero, was slated to face 300 soldiers, nearly
        six times the previous record. This was clearly meant to be his final match.
        Jarvan II, hearing of this unprecedented feat, infiltrated the arena to offer
        him an alternative: serve Demacia and punish those who ultimately sentence
        him to death in exchange for his freedom. Xin Zhao accepted, astonished that
        a king would risk his own life on his behalf. Under the cover of a prearranged
        Demacian assault on Noxus, Jarvan liberated Xin Zhao and his 300 opponents.
        During their retreat, Xin Zhao took a poisoned dart meant for Jarvan. This
        act of loyalty, from a man who vowed no allegiance, earned Xin Zhao a spot
        at his side until the day the king died. Now in the service of his son, Jarvan
        III, Xin Zhao is stepping into a new ring - the Fields of Justice - to fight
        for his adopted country and to honor the legacy of the man who gave purpose
        to his life.', quote: 'Death is inevitable, one can only avoid defeat.', quote_author: Demacian

        or skill with arms.  Others simply refuse to die.  Urgot, once a great soldier
        of Noxus, may constitute a case in support of the latter.  Prone to diving
        headlong into enemy battle lines, Urgot sowed chaos throughout the enemy ranks,
        often sustaining grievous injuries in the process. When his body was unable
        to weather further abuse, the crippled Urgot was delegated the position of
        High Executioner of Noxus.  By this time, his hands had been ruined and he
        could barely walk.  Scythe-like grafts affixed to his maimed limbs served
        to carry out his bloody work.


        Urgot finally met his end at what should have been his finest hour.  Because
        of his military background, he often accompanied detachments into foreign
        territory to carry out judgment.  After ambushing an enemy force, Jarvan IV,
        Crown Prince of Demacia, fell into the clutches of Urgot''s division.  Too
        far from Noxus to risk transporting their prize for ransom, Urgot prepared
        to dispose of their captive.  At the final moment, however, the Dauntless
        Vanguard, led by Garen, the Might of Demacia, intervened, and Urgot was cut
        in two by the zealous warrior as he scrambled to free his Prince.  In recognition
        of his service, the executioner''s remains were remanded to the Bleak Academy
        for reanimation.  A lifetime of abuse, however, had left his body in a catastrophic
        state; proving problematic to the necromancers'' craft.  Professor Stanwick
        Pididly, the prevailing scholar of Zaun, offered a solution.  Within Pididly''s
        laboratories, a nightmarish new body was forged for Urgot.  Now as much machine
        as man, Urgot arrived at the League of Legends in search of the man who ended
        his life; necromantic energies coursing through his metal veins.', quote: We

    lore: {desc: 'Every city has its dark side, even one whose reputation is already
        of a questionable hue. Noxus - though its name is already invoked with a mixture
        of reverence and revulsion - is no exception to this simple truth. Deep within
        the winding dungeons that honeycomb the earth beneath its dark, meandering
        streets lies the real underbelly of this sprawling metropolis, a haven for
        all manner of malevolence. Amongst the cults, covens, and secret societies
        that call this labyrinth their home, LeBlanc, the Deceiver, presides over
        the Black Rose, a remnant from a lost, yet similarly unscrupulous time in
        Noxian history. Ruthless and seemingly ageless, LeBlanc and her ilk were a
        mainstay in Noxian political affairs during the era before the militarization
        of the Noxian government. In those days, this guild of powerful magicians
        met in secret to further their hidden agenda, and to hone a craft more subtle
        than that preferred by those currently in power.


        While their exact motives have always remained mysterious, it was widely believed
        that the Black Rose was the true power behind the throne while the aristocracy
        still reigned in Noxus. When raw martial prowess became the ultimate determination
        of whose will held sway in the Empire, the Black Rose seemed to vanish overnight.
        Many believed that perhaps their time had simply passed, and that its members
        had put aside their quests for social and political dominance. When LeBlanc
        reemerged at the gates of the Institute of War, however, it became clear that
        these masters of shadow and flame had simply been biding their time, waiting

        Tempest Flats, where the secrets of an ancient and terrifying sorcery are
        kept.  The area surrounding the temple is littered with the exsanguinated
        corpses of those who have mistakenly wandered too close.  These served only
        to pique the curiosity of Vladimir, when - in his youth - he trekked through
        these mountains during his flight from Noxus.  A day earlier, the teenaged
        Vladimir had brutally murdered two boys his age, for no better reason than
        to enjoy the intoxicating scarlet bloom that surged forth.  He realized immediately
        that he would never be able to suppress his murderous desires, and if he remained
        in Noxus, his foul deeds were sure to catch up with him.  Without hesitation,
        he abandoned the city-state, and journeyed south.


        The trail of bodies led him to a crumbling stone temple.  Inside he found
        an aging monk who appraised him with eyes of pure crimson.  Vladimir surprised
        the monk by returning the wicked gaze with zeal.  Recognizing the boy''s sinister
        craving, the monk taught Vladimir how to manipulate and control the fluid
        of life, often practicing on passing travelers.  When it came time for Vladimir
        to learn the final lesson, the monk warned that failure would result in death.  Vladimir
        did not fail, but success bore a grisly surprise.  During the ritual, every
        drop of the monk''s blood was drawn from his body and fused with Vladimir''s,
        imbuing him with his master''s magical essence, and that of every hemomancer
        before him.  Left alone and suddenly without purpose, Vladimir resolved to
        return to Noxus, demanding enrollment in the League to prove the supremacy
        of his craft.  When the Noxian High Command observed the gruesome fates which

    lore: {desc: 'For nearly twenty years, Fiddlesticks has stood alone in the easternmost
        summoning chamber of the Institute of War.  Only the burning emerald light
        of his unearthly gaze pierces the musty darkness of his dust-covered home.  It
        is here that the Harbinger of Doom keeps a silent vigil.  His is a cautionary
        tale of power run amok, taught to all summoners within the League.  Decades
        ago, there existed a powerful rune mage from Zaun - Istvaan.  At the end of
        the fifth Rune War, he became one of the League''s first summoners.  Too much
        a prisoner to the old ways of magic, Istvaan stepped further and further outside
        the rules of conduct in the League.  In what was ultimately his last match,
        his reach finally exceeded his grasp.  Sealing himself inside the easternmost
        summoning chamber, he began incanting the most forbidden of rituals - an extra-planar
        summoning.


        What exactly happened inside that chamber remains unknown.  No champion came
        to represent Zaun that day in Summoner''s Rift.  Only silence echoed back
        from repeated knocks on the chamber door.  The first apprentice who entered
        was cut down immediately by an unearthly scythe.  What few who followed and
        survived were driven mad by fear, mere husks of men gibbering about crows
        and death.  Afraid of the evil even Istvaan could not control, the League
        sealed all exits to the chamber, hoping they could contain what they could
        not destroy.  Years went by, but the wooden figure within never moved save
        to slay any foolish enough to enter.  Seeing no recourse to reclaim the chamber,
        the Council instead devised a use for Fiddlesticks: executioner.  While he
        comes to life and seemingly abides by the rules of summoning in the Fields
        of Justice, what he awaits inside his chamber is unknown.  His unmoving face
        yields no clues, and his scythe stands ready to strike down any who stand
        before him.

    lore: {desc: 'In a world far away where an ancient war still rages, Kayle was
        a great hero - the strongest of an immortal race committed to destroying evil
        wherever it could be found.  For ten thousand years, Kayle fought tirelessly
        for her people, wielding her flaming sword forged before time itself. She
        shielded her delicate features beneath her enchanted armor, the sole remaining
        masterpiece of an extinct race of craftsmen.  Though a beautiful, striking
        creature, Kayle, now as then, avoids showing her face; war has taken a terrible
        toll upon her spirit.  In her quest for victory, she sometimes would try to
        lift the wicked up from their morass of evil, but more than often she instead
        purged those she herself deemed beyond redemption.  To Kayle, justice can
        so often be an ugly thing.


        Ten years ago, Kayle''s war against evil was nearly won... until her rebellious
        sister Morgana, a pariah amongst their people, suddenly gained powerful new
        allies: magicians of a hitherto unknown world called Runeterra.  Morgana traded
        servitude to a number of the summoners in Runeterra''s League of Legends for
        powerful new abilities that, if mastered, threatened to bring Kayle and her
        people to their knees. To save her world, Kayle had no choice but to make
        a pact with the League herself.  She approached the leader of the League,
        High Counselor Reginald Ashram, with a deal of her own.  In exchange for a
        thousand years of Kayle''s service, Ashram halted all League interference
        on Kayle''s world.  With Ashram''s disappearance five years ago, Kayle has
        new causes on Valoran: find out who or what caused Ashram to disappear, defeat
        her sister Morgana upon the Fields of Justice, and bring her own brand of
        justice to the League of Legends.', quote: 'In the League of Legends, Justice

    lore: {desc: 'Keeper of the ancient art of Wuju, Master Yi is a mystical warrior
        from the isle of Ionia.  He descended from one of the few tribes dedicated
        to the preservation of Wuju, a martial art founded with the principles of
        absolute spiritual awareness of one''s self and one''s enemy.  When the armies
        of Noxus invaded Ionia, Master Yi joined in the Ionian defense to fight the
        craven enemy, bringing his village honor through his unparalleled mastery
        of the blade.  The ensuing battles ravaged the land, but no conflict inflicted
        as much horror as the day the armies of Noxus closed in on Yi''s village.
        Left undefended, the village became the unfortunate test subject of the latest
        invention by an up-and-coming chemist, now known as Singed. The remains of
        the village that Master Yi returned to were so horrific that it remains a
        festering scar on Ionian history.  To this day, no Ionian will ever publicly
        speak of what occurred.


        After the Noxian invasion was contained, Master Yi fell into a deep isolation.  For
        years, he trained morning to night, speaking to no one and refusing offers
        of consolation by fellow Ionians.  The only thing stopping him from madly
        charging into Noxus battle lines headfirst was his pledge to keep the Wuju
        style alive.  Even though he seethed with impatience, his rage became a tool
        for sharpening his practice of Wuju, developing stronger and deadlier skills
        for his eventual vengeance.  The only thing that roused him was news of the
        League''s formation, and Noxus'' subsequent enrollment in the League. Master
        Yi now brings his mastery of the blade to the League of Legends with unflinching
        purpose: to avenge his kinfolk and end the predations of the Noxus once and
        for all.', quote: 'The art of Wuju lives on in Master Yi, and is plunged through

    lore: {desc: 'As the mightiest warrior to ever emerge from the Minotaur tribes
        of the Great Barrier, Alistar defended his tribe from Valoran''s many dangers;
        that is, until the coming of the Noxian army. Alistar was lured from his village
        by the machinations of Keiran Darkwill, General Boram Darkwill''s youngest
        son and commander of the Noxian expeditionary force. When Alistar returned,
        he found his village burning and his family slain. Bellowing with rage, he
        charged an entire regiment of Noxus'' elite, slaughtering them by the hundreds.
        Only the intervention of some of Noxus'' most skilled summoners checked Alistar''s
        rage. Brought in chains to Noxus, Alistar spent the intervening years as a
        gladiator in the Fleshing, pitted in endless battle for the entertainment
        of Noxus'' wealthy leaders.


        Alistar''s once noble soul slowly became twisted, and he would have been driven
        to insanity if not for Ayelia, a young servant girl who befriended him and
        eventually arranged for his escape. Suddenly free, Alistar joined the newly
        formed League of Legends to fight as a champion, hoping to one day exact his
        final vengeance upon Noxus and find the girl who had renewed his hope. Initially
        unwilling to cater to his celebrity status as a champion, Alistar has since
        discovered that there is power in fame, and he has become a vocal advocate
        for those whom the Noxian government treads upon. He also calls to light things
        that the Noxian military would prefer remain hidden -- something that has
        made him very unpopular with Noxus'' nobles. His charitable work has earned
        him several philanthropic awards, which serve as an interesting contrast to
        the rage and destruction he brings to the League of Legends.

    lore: {desc: 'There are many on Runeterra who are attracted to the study of magic
        or, in recent times, the emerging field of techmaturgy. For most, pursuit
        of such knowledge is formalized in a college or university. The halls of traditional
        study were never for Ryze, however, who felt a more raw and primal connection
        to the magic of Runeterra than those who tried to teach him. He struck out
        on his own as a young man to discover what already called to him. Ryze traveled
        the world, seeking the wisdom of powerful hermits, witches, and shamans -
        anyone who had something to share beyond what was taught in the city-states
        of Valoran. When he had learned all he could from these fonts of wisdom, Ryze
        turned to seek the lost, forgotten, and forbidden knowledge in the world,
        delving into mystical worlds where others feared to tread.


        Ryze''s tireless searching for magical knowledge led him to an ancient form
        of spellcraft known as thorn magic. This art required Ryze to tattoo spells
        on his body, permanently infusing his being with vast arcane power and finally
        fulfilling his need to bond with the mystical energies of Runeterra. His travels
        also led him to uncover the giant indestructible scroll he now carries on
        his back - the purpose of the inscribed spell remains a secret only Ryze knows.
        He claims it is an abomination - something that he must safeguard from the
        world. This has piqued the curiosity of many, though no one is sure how to
        separate the scroll from Ryze, or if it is possible to overcome the rogue
        mage to do so. Since then, Ryze has joined the League of Legends to study
        the magical creatures and powerful will-workers that fight there, in order
        to complete his exploration of mystical Runeterra.', quote: Ryze is no longer

    lore: {desc: 'Prior to the creation of the League of Legends, the city-states
        of Demacia and Noxus were locked in a brutal series of on-again-off-again
        wars that spanned the course of centuries.  Both powers sought an advantage
        over the other, but Noxus was the city-state willing to forego conventional
        morality to achieve its goals.  Only brute strength and the will to use it
        mattered to Noxus, and this is best exemplified in the murderous warrior,
        Sion.  Used by the Noxians as a human battering ram, Sion would be sent thundering
        ahead of Noxian troops.  He would mercilessly slaughter foes with his large
        double-bladed axe, "Chopper". His complete disregard for caution ultimately
        cost him his life, as he was captured and summarily executed by Demacian forces.


        The Demacians thought that the beheading of Sion would be the end of his bloodthirsty
        ways.  Death, however, was merely the beginning of Sion''s rise to power.  The
        famed Noxian assassin, Katarina, recovered Sion''s remains and Noxian necromancers
        reanimated the behemoth to serve Noxus once again.  Sion''s reanimation actually
        bestowed new powers on him and increased the potency of his existing abilities,
        making him even more of a terror to behold on the battlefield.  The Noxian
        High Command had a powerful new weapon in their hands - one they have brought
        to bear as a champion in the League of Legends.  Even though Sion''s increased
        powers would make him a powerful tool for the High Command''s use outside
        the Fields of Justice, Noxus no longer risks losing one of their greatest
        champions in the League to chance or circumstance; Sion''s days as a front-line
        fighter for Noxus'' military conquests are at an end.', quote: 'For Noxus,

        of League summoners for close to a decade.  A soldier-for-hire outside of
        the Fields of Justice, she is the embodiment of a highly successful mercenary
        on modern day Runeterra.  Sivir has little interest in the "cribbage sheets"
        - as she calls them - of League influence bartering.  Instead, she is motivated
        by material wealth and riches, and she is paid handsomely for her services.  Sivir
        is one of the wealthiest individuals found anywhere on Valoran.  Sivir owns
        multiple residences in a number of different city-states, as well as ownership
        stakes in a number of businesses all across Valoran.  Her detractors, either
        envious of her success or acrimonious of her flexible morality, have begun
        to use Sivir as a symbol of what is wrong with the mercenary nature of the
        League.  Sivir dismisses her critics, saying that while her personal code
        of ethics is less ruthless than her competitors, "Everyone has a price."


        Sivir has earned many titles and accolades throughout her illustrious career,
        but the one she held until recently was "Battle Mistress of Noxus". Now she
        is simply known as "The Battle Mistress" after breaking her contract with
        the Noxian High Command.  Sivir dared to object to the Noxian war against
        the peaceful island state of Ionia, though less about the morality of the
        issue than the planning behind it; her predictions of a bloody stalemate came
        true when the Ionians held off the relentless assaults of the Noxians.  Claiming
        that the Noxian High Command had lost its direction, she left Noxus and made
        her services available to the Institute of War.  The Noxian High Command has
        sent a number of contracted assassins to deal with its rogue mercenary, but
        none have delivered her or survived.', quote: 'Time and time again, Sivir

    lore: {desc: 'A healer gifted with the magic of the stars, Soraka holds all living
        creatures close to her heart. She was once a celestial being, but she sacrificed
        her immortality and entered the world of mortals. So long as evil threatens
        life in Valoran, Soraka will not allow herself peace.


        Soraka lived for centuries in an enchanted grove. A being of the stars, she
        healed the wounded and sick that sought her out. One man called Warwick came
        to her grove and begged her to heal his wife, who lay lifeless in his arms.
        His despair touched Soraka''s heart. Though it was too late to save his wife,
        she offered to help heal the pain of his loss. Unwilling to let go of his
        grief Warwick ran from the grove, but returned over the following days to
        hear Soraka''s guidance. She began to grow attached to the grieving man. One
        day Warwick told her he had found the men who killed his wife. He believed
        revenge would heal his pain - and if he died fighting, he would at least find
        peace. Though she pleaded with him, Warwick ignored her and left the grove.
        The voices of the stars warned her not to follow him, but Soraka had to intervene.


        She stepped into the mortal world for the first time, and soon found Warwick
        desperately fighting a group of men. She tried to heal him, but for every
        wound she closed, the men inflicted two more. Soraka realized that she would
        have to fight to save her friend. The stars screamed in her mind, telling
        her not to use her powers for harm. Ignoring their warning, she struck the
        attackers with a flash of brilliant light. Crying out in terror and shielding
        their eyes from her divine radiance, they fled. Soraka''s celestial form faded
        and the stars fell silent - for her transgression, she became mortal. She
        still felt the power of the stars within her, but they no longer offered her
        guidance. She took comfort in Warwick''s safety, gently healing his wounds,
        but the man she had called her friend slipped a dagger between her ribs. As
        her blood spilled, Soraka realized he had fooled her, and everything he had
        done was a complicated ruse. Feeling humiliated and betrayed she called once
        more on the power of the stars, searing his flesh and cursing his cruelty.
        He retreated with an agonized howl, leaving Soraka to reflect upon her fate.
        Though her life had changed, she felt empowered and renewed with a singular
        purpose. No longer bound to the grove, Soraka set out into the mortal world,
        vowing to heal the wounded and protect the helpless.', quote: The cruelty

    lore: {desc: 'Teemo is a legend among his yordle brothers and sisters in Bandle
        City. As far as yordles are concerned, there is something just slightly off
        about him. While Teemo enjoys the companionship of other yordles, he also
        insists on frequent solo missions in the ongoing defense of Bandle City. Despite
        his genuinely warm personality, something switches off inside Teemo''s mind
        during combat so that the lives he must end while on patrol do not burden
        him. Even as a young recruit, the drill instructors and other trainees found
        it a little disconcerting that, while Teemo was normally charming and kind,
        he turned deadly serious and highly efficient the minute combat exercises
        began. Teemo''s superiors quickly steered him toward the Scouts of the Mothership,
        which is one of Bandle City''s most distinguished Special Forces unit alongside
        the Megling Commandos.


        While most yordles do not handle solo scouting missions with a great deal
        of finesse, Teemo is remarkably efficient at them. His record of success in
        defending Bandle City from infiltrators easily makes him one of the most dangerous
        yordles alive, though you''d never know it by having a cup of honey mead with
        him at his favorite inn. Bandle City chose Teemo as their first champion for
        the League, and he has taken to it like a duck to water. His signature weapon
        - a blowgun - uses a rare ajunta poison he personally gathers from the jungles
        of Kumungu. To help cope with his lengthy periods of isolation, Teemo recently
        struck up a friendship with Tristana, a fellow League champion and fellow
        member of Bandle City''s Special Forces. This connection is healthy for both
        yordles, though now Valoran''s voracious media outlets circulate rumors that
        the friendship is turning into a romantic relationship. Regardless, Teemo
        is a crowd favorite in the League of Legends, and a pint-sized foe that many
        have come to fear.', quote: 'Teemo rides a thin line between chipper compatriot

        are still heard throughout Valoran''s taverns. It was these legends that most

        the military and able to earn her place among the Megling Commandos. The senior
        officers were impressed by her abilities, claiming that Tristana was a natural,
        and her dream was realized the day she donned her Megling fatigues.


        Though her heart lies with her unit, the call to the League of Legends was

    lore: {desc: 'Warwick was once a man revered for his ability to track down human
        specimens for the darkest types of scientific research. When his ambitions
        exceeded his physical limits, he drank a dangerous elixir to transform himself
        into an unstoppable manhunter.  His newfound strength bore a heavy price.


        Before his transformation, Warwick found his calling in Zaun as a "procurer"
        of human test subjects. Known for his crafty methods and ruthless determination,
        people regarded him with a cautious mixture of fear and respect. As his reputation
        grew, so did the demands placed upon him. His clients wanted more rare and
        dangerous specimens, and they wanted them sooner. To meet their demands, Warwick
        needed strength that transcended his limited human form. His longtime friend,
        Singed, devised a powerful formula. The recipe called for three critical components:
        silver from the Shadow Isles, the fang of a Balefire dire wolf, and the heart
        of a celestial being. Warwick tracked down the first two in short order, but
        the third proved a much greater challenge. He traveled to Ionia to trap Soraka,
        a creature believed to be a child of the stars, but she discovered his ploy
        and drove him away with powerful magic. Unable to tolerate his failure, Warwick
        returned to Singed disfigured and furious. He demanded the chemist''s incomplete
        potion, but Singed warned him that the results would be unpredictable. Ignoring
        his friend''s warning, Warwick drank the concoction. The brew transformed
        him into a creature both man and wolf, infusing him with raw strength and
        heightened senses. Exhilarated, he immediately began testing his newfound
        power. Each day his instincts became sharper, but his human half slipped further
        away. He could feel himself losing control: though he always got his prey,
        he often failed to bring them back alive. Now he seeks the heart of Soraka
        to stabilize his transformation before his mind gives way to the feral urges
        of the beast.', quote: Eventually the beast catches up with all of us., quote_author: Warwick}

    lore: {desc: 'Freljord is an unforgiving land covered in snow and ice. Travel,
        especially in the winter, can be very dangerous. The elements often claim
        even those who have spent their entire lives there. The boy known as Nunu
        is defined by such tragedy. One day when he was a young child, Nunu rode on
        his father''s back as they returned from a trapping expedition in the mountains.
        An unexpected blizzard came upon them, forcing them to seek refuge in a cave.
        The tempest was the worst in countless years, and it lasted for days. Nunu''s
        father left to find food, but he never returned.


        The blizzard eventually cleared, and the young child lay dying on the mountainside.
        Fortunately for Nunu, this was the land of the yetis, who are powerful beasts
        with whom Nunu''s father had secured an arrangement for safe passage. A young
        yeti boy named Willump found Nunu and brought him home. From then on Nunu
        was raised by the yetis, whose culture remains a mystery to most Runeterrans.
        The boy quickly discovered that the seemingly savage creatures were in fact
        deeply spiritual beings living in harmony with their environment. They are
        very territorial and unafraid of defending themselves if called upon to do
        so. The yetis have watched the rest of Valoran, and they can smell the change
        on the wind. When the League of Legends was formed, the yetis knew they needed
        a champion. Riding his brother Willump, Nunu became that champion. Those who
        follow the League know that the boy is mature beyond his years, but, while
        he appears human, his mind is that of his adoptive kin.

    lore: {desc: 'For those who brave the harsh seas of Runeterra, attaining one''s
        own ship and crew is the pinnacle of success. Sarah Fortune, a well-respected
        (some would say legendary) bounty hunter from Bilgewater, was able to achieve
        this feat just after her sixteenth birthday, etching out her name as the go-to
        gal for resolving special troubles. No bounty was too difficult or too dangerous
        for her feminine charm and her renowned use of her twin pistols, "Shock and
        Awe". Her success gave her the means to legitimately purchase her own ship...
        with a little flirtatious haggling, of course. Things weren''t always so fortunate
        for Miss Fortune, though. When she was young, trade ships began to dot the
        horizon of her quiet home in the northern shores of Blue Flame Island''s largest
        chunk. Trade routes brought piracy, and the inhabitants soon found themselves
        caught in a frenzy of pillage.


        One day, young Sarah returned home to hear gunshots and screaming. Her front
        door was smashed open; inside, she saw her mother lying in a pool of blood.
        A sudden blow to her head made her collapse next to her slain mother. The
        last thing she could remember were her attacker''s red eyes, as his face was
        blocked by a rogue''s bandana. Miss Fortune has a strong distrust for pirates
        and she finds herself constantly bickering with the infamous Gangplank (the
        only captain to resist her charms) over the direction of Bilgewater politics.
        Her two goals: to unite the people of Bilgewater, making them into a strong
        and independent society, and to find the pirate who killed her mother. To
        that end, she has entered the League of Legends as a champion, trading her
        skills for the wealth and influence that will help her accomplish both.',

    lore: {desc: 'One of the perennial favorites of summoners in the League of Legends
        is the Freljordian beauty known as Ashe. She is a direct descendant of Avarosa
        - one of three legendary sisters who each claimed dominion over the scattered
        tribes dwelling in the icy tundra of northern Valoran. Ashe mirrors her ancestor''s
        unparalleled mastery of the bow, earning her the title of "The Frost Archer"
        the way Avarosa did during her era. Ashe is a literal Princess amongst her
        people, though she prefers to be addressed by outsiders as her tribal title
        rather than any form of royal moniker. There are those in Freljord, however,
        that would prefer to address Ashe as the "late" Frost Archer; the other two
        tribes that are descendants from the Three Sisters are historically sworn
        enemies of Ashe and her people. Having survived more than one assassination
        attempt in her life, Ashe is always aware of her surroundings regardless of
        where she is.


        Ashe originally came to the Institute of War in service of the League summoners,
        seeking enough influence and favor to finally bring peace to her realm - one
        that has endured civil strife since Avarosa and the Time of the Three Sisters.
        With countless victories under her belt, she has started to put the influence
        she has earned in the League to use. Rumors abound that Ashe has begun to
        associate herself with fellow champion Tryndamere outside of the Fields of
        Justice. While she denies such talk as frivolous, all eyes will remain on
        Ashe now that her success in the League may finally allow her to restore lasting
        peace to her people.', quote: It's a good idea to spread out. Ashe can hit

        or barbarian tribe. While perils abound in these untamed lands, there is also
        great freedom in being removed from the politics of Valoran. Tryndamere was
        born a member of one of these barbarian tribes in northern Valoran. Even as
        a young boy, it was obvious that he would grow in martial prowess to become
        one of his clan''s greatest warriors. However, as his clan moved south between
        the Howling Marsh and the Ironspike Mountains, they came across strangers
        in black garb, brandishing symbols of a beast''s skull. Despite Tryndamere''s
        pleas, his elder went out to speak with the strangers; they cut him down mercilessly.
        From there, they began to slaughter every man, woman, and child in the clan.
        Tryndamere, the sole survivor, hid under the bodies of his dead parents. Upon
        their bloodied corpses, he swore eternal vengeance on those who took his people
        from him - the assassins of Noxus.


        To train himself, Tryndamere voluntarily served under all the great chieftains
        of the barbarian tribes, learning the ways of the barbarian warrior. Not only
        did this make him the man he needed to become in order to exact his revenge,
        it has also garnered him friends and allies among the most powerful barbarian
        leaders of Valoran. This recently allowed him to unite the barbarians into
        a single, powerful force - all under his command. Now he has joined the League

    lore: {desc: 'It is seldom the case where a champion is defined by his actions
        after joining the League of Legends rather than before. Such is the case with
        Jax, for whom the argument could be made that he is the most prolific tournament
        fighter currently at the Institute of War. Before joining the League, Jax
        was an unremarkable soldier-for-hire. For reasons known only to the former
        leader of the League, High Councilor Reginald Ashram, Jax was put on the top
        of the list of candidates to receive a League Judgment - the interview process
        that either accepts or rejects a prospective champion. His Judgment was the
        quickest in League history, where the Doors of Acceptance glowed and slowly
        swung open as soon as it began.  Jax faced no recorded Observation or Reflection
        during his Judgment.


        Jax proved himself to be an immediate terror in the Fields of Justice. The
        self-proclaimed "Armsmaster of the League" rattled off a streak of consecutive
        wins that to this day has not been matched. A number of summoners in the League
        grew concerned that the perceived objectivity of the League of Legends would
        be questioned by the presence of an unknown fighter who was unbeatable. For
        this reason, the new leader of the League (following Reginald Ashram''s disappearance),
        High Councilor Heyward Relivash, created special restrictions for Jax to fight
        under. This was something the League had never done before, and something
        that has never been done since. The burly fighter responded by imposing his
        own special conditions; as a means of protest, he permitted himself to fight
        using only a brass lamppost. Neither the League''s sanctions nor his own has
        affected his winning ways. The League has since rescinded its sanctions, but
        Jax has not; he fights and fights well with his trusty brass lamppost.', quote: Be
        advised - there has been an outbreak of lamppost-shaped bruises in the League

    lore: {desc: 'There is a world far away populated by graceful and beautiful winged
        beings gifted with immortality, where an ancient conflict still rages. Like
        so many conflicts, this war split families. One side proclaimed themselves
        as beings of perfect order and justice, fighting to unite the world under
        their law and strong central governance. Those that fought against them saw
        their kin as tyrants, creatures incapable of seeing the larger view, who would
        sacrifice individuality and freedom for the illusion of efficiency and safety.
        Morgana was one who fought against what she perceived as the tyranny of her
        kind, and for that she was branded "fallen." Morgana was not innocent, having
        plumbed forgotten ways to gather forbidden might to become a powerful mistress
        of the black arts. This goal was driven by her obsession to defeat the general
        of the opposition''s army - her sister, Kayle.


        While the two were in fact birth-sisters, Kayle struck the first blow by disowning
        any filial connection when Morgana refused to join her cause. Eventually,
        Morgana grew in power enough to not only reach, but challenge Kayle. As the
        time approached when the two would meet in what could be their final conflict,
        Morgana was suddenly summoned to Valoran. At first, Morgana made a deal with
        the League''s summoners to fight in exchange for greater power. With the advent
        of Kayle into the League, Morgana now willingly fights in the League of Legends
        for the privilege of being able to destroy her sister again, and again, and
        again. She lies in wait for the day the bonds of the Institute of War no longer
        hold her, and on that day she plans to destroy Kayle once and for all and
        return home a hero.', quote: There is no rest while Kayle's brand of tyranny

    lore: {desc: 'In the wastelands of Urtistan, there was once a great city. It perished
        long ago in a terrible Rune War, like most of the lands below the Great Barrier.
        Nevertheless, one man survived: a sorcerer named Zilean. Being obsessed with
        time, it was only fitting that he dwelled in the city''s Clock Tower. As the
        havoc of the war neared his home, Zilean experimented with powerful temporal
        magic to divine all possible futures, hoping to discover a peaceful solution.
        But Zilean''s enchantments affected his perception of the passage of time,
        and he was in a contemplative stasis when Urtistan was set upon by an entire
        phalanx of dark summoner-knights of unknown affiliation. By the time he realized
        his error, Urtistan was nothing more than smoldering debris. The summoners
        who were responsible for its destruction had wisely left the Clock Tower unharmed,
        both to avoid drawing Zilean''s attention and to torment him for his oversight.


        Zilean barely had time to grieve the momentous loss before he learned that
        his dangerous research had a cruel side effect: chrono-displasia. This mystical
        disease granted him immortality, but detached his consciousness from its anchor
        in the present time. He now mentally drifts through time, from any point he
        has already lived to the present, unable to impact the events which unfold.
        The most torturous aspect of this curse is that Zilean sometimes experiences
        Urtistan as it once was and the rest of the time resides in its lonely ruins.
        Only the powerful summoning magic employed by members of the League of Legends
        has been able to treat this condition, and Zilean has joined in hopes of finding
        a cure, and thereafter a way to save his people.', quote: There is no greater

    lore: {desc: 'Singed descended from a long line of Zaun''s revered chemists. Even
        in his youth, his talent for concocting potions far outstripped that of his
        peers, and he quickly distinguished himself from his less extraordinary chemist
        compatriots. It came as no surprise to anyone when he was selected for apprenticeship
        by the infamous Warwick, master apothecary on a lucrative retainer with the
        Noxian military during their campaign against Ionia. Within Warwick''s laboratories,
        Singed toiled without end, rapidly absorbing every detail of his predecessor''s
        deadly craft. Singed had little concern for the death and destruction that
        was the fruit of his labors. By the time the curse of lycanthropy descended
        to claim his master, Singed was poised and eager to make the transition from
        workhorse to innovator; he was ready to share his genius by bringing a new
        brand of suffering to the Ionian front. His zeal for progress was unquenchable,
        and when suitable test subjects proved to be in short supply, the eager chemist
        was often thought to turn his volatile mixtures on his own flesh.


        When the uneasy peace created by the League of Legends settled on the world,
        Singed journeyed to the one place where he was still able to showcase his
        beloved craft: the Institute of War. By this time he was barely even a man,
        his body both ruined and sustained by his ingenious craft. A thousand burns
        - accidents of shadow and flame - mar his ravaged form, and exposure to such
        harsh conditions has deadened his nerves, hardened his body, and strengthened
        his physique, transforming him into a veritable juggernaut. This, combined
        with a formidable arsenal of deadly concoctions, makes Singed a force to be
        reckoned with on the Fields of Justice.', quote: My deadliest dose shall bear

    lore: {desc: 'Evelynn''s origins are shrouded in mystery - a mystery she herself
        helps to perpetuate.  What everyone does know about Evelynn, however, is that
        she is one of the most skilled assassins in Valoran.  It is clear upon first
        meeting her that she is not quite human.  Some theorize that she was cursed
        with a mild form of fantastical vampirism as a child.  Supporters of this
        theory contend that her ability to sap the very life essence of her opponents
        on (and off) the Fields of Justice, while still being able to tolerate direct
        sunlight, would account for this belief.  There is some evidence that Evelynn
        originally came from the Shadow Isles - the mysterious island located northwest
        of Valoran that is eternally blanketed by a thick, unnatural fog.  It is thought
        that the Shadow Isles are home to countless forms of undead, though no one
        seems eager to perform the exploration necessary to find out the truth.  Evelynn
        neither confirms nor denies her connection to Shadow Isles.


        The power brokers of Valoran know that Evelynn''s services come at the highest
        of premiums, and her recent addition to the League of Legends indicates that
        her ambitions are growing.  Her savagery on the Fields of Justice has been
        so great that new rumors about her origins are now circulating.  The most
        popular one - an abuse of magic as a child morphed her into the hungering
        beast her opponents see on the battlefield - always makes her smile when hearing
        it... an act that bares her razor-sharp fangs and teeth.  Evelynn now curries
        favor from League summoners, gaining influence for reasons known only to her.  While
        the nature of her plans- much like almost everything else about her - remains
        unknown, there''s little doubt that those plans are now set on the world stage.',

    lore: {desc: 'The city-state of Zaun is a twisted realm of science, mercantilism,
        and magic run amok.  While the young science of techmaturgy does much to advance
        civilization, its research and use in Zaun pushes the boundaries of morality
        on a daily basis.  Zaun, choked with pollution from the countless factories
        and laboratories that spew waste into the environment, suffers greatly.  As
        polluted as Zaun is above-ground, its subterranean levels are far worse.  All
        of Zaun''s runoff waste pooled together in its sewers, mixing into a toxic
        and mysterious concoction.  A single plague rat rose from this alchemical
        nightmare - Twitch.  Unlike his lesser evolved cousins, Twitch became as sentient
        as anyone else... provided they were as insane as he.  A seeming byproduct
        of the evolutionary brew that spawned him was maniacal insanity, albeit in
        a functional form.


        Twitch came to the League of Legends to represent himself "as the only one
        of his kind" on the Fields of Justice.  Since then, he has found a generous
        benefactor in the city that gave him his evolutionary sentience - Zaun.  Twitch
        is one of Zaun''s premier champions in the League, and as such he fights for
        Zaun when political disputes between Valoran''s city-states arise.  Twitch
        has publically stated that his goal is to gain enough influence and materiel
        from his work in the League to try to recreate the process by which he gained
        his sentience.  While many challenges lie ahead in his quest - one of the
        largest being his own insanity - were he to succeed, it would mean a bold
        and brazen step forward in the evolution of all of Runeterra.  Zaun has pledged
        its support for Twitch in his quest, though it remains to be seen what Zaun''s
        ulterior motives are in the matter.', quote: The existence of Twitch proves

    internal_name: Karthus
    lore: {desc: 'Karthus is a terrible creature who was once a mortal so obsessed
        with death that he eagerly embraced the gift of undeath. Now in his unlife
        as a lich, Karthus is closer to his beloved grave than he ever imagined. He
        commands magic with oblivion as its source, and seeks to bring his grim truth
        to the rest of the world: only in death does life gain clarity and purpose.


        Even as a boy, Karthus was different. There was a darkness within him that
        could not be denied. The young child clung to the shadows and shunned the
        company of others. He snuck into the funerals of strangers, and spoke to their
        tombstones in the cemetery. He sought out corpses of animals to preserve and
        memorialize them, creating a grim collection of morbid art. Karthus volunteered
        to tend to the sick and dying, though his intentions were not to help, but
        to closely witness the passing of those who were beyond help. Ultimately,
        he went so far as to elaborately stage his death, and he secretly observed
        his own funeral with intense fascination. When others discovered what Karthus
        had done, they were so shocked and disturbed that, in a way, he became truly
        dead to them.  Karthus found himself fully rejected by the living.


        His isolation only served to fuel his obsession. Karthus delved further into
        his exploration of death, and became fascinated by the legends of the Shadow
        Isles. There, it was said, the specters of the deceased continued on in unlife
        everlasting. Possessed by these tales, he knew he had to discover for himself
        if they were true. Journeying to those dreaded isles, Karthus soon found himself
        wandering through the mist, overcome by the surreal beauty of the place. He
        felt as if he had finally come home. He had always chased the elusive purity
        of the moment of death, when life passed and in a single instant achieved
        meaning. Karthus saw that undeath was like that moment, preserved in dread
        stillness forever. He had discovered his destiny, to cross over the veil and
        leave the living behind for eternity. Something awoke in the Shadow Isles
        that day, when Karthus did something no other creature had ever done: he willingly
        gave  his life over to undeath. When he reentered the world, Karthus had become
        the embodiment of his own obsession. An undying lich with the keys to life
        and death, he seeks to bring his dark requiem to the world.', quote: There

        empty place, but rather the home of unspeakable things - horrors not meant
        for minds of men.  Cho''Gath is a creature born of the Void, a thing whose
        true nature is so awful most will not speak its name.  Its fellows have been
        poking at the walls that divide dimensions for a crack, a way into Runeterra,
        where they can visit their own personal paradise of horror upon the world.  They
        are called the Voidborn, creatures so ancient and terrible that they have
        been removed from history altogether.  It is rumored that the Voidborn command
        vast armies of unspeakable creatures on other worlds, that they were once
        driven from Runeterra by powerful magic lost to antiquity.


        If such tales are true, then the rumors that follow must be equally true -
        that one day, the Voidborn will return.  Even now, something dark stirs in
        Icathia, perverting the summoning rituals of the League to allow the presence
        of Cho''Gath.  It is an alien creature of malice and violence, a thing that
        causes all but the most stalwart to cringe in fear.  Cho''Gath even appears
        to feed on its predations, growing and swelling as it gorges itself.  Worse
        yet, the creature is intelligent, perhaps greatly so, making most wonder how
        such a monster could be contained.  Fortunately, the power of the League''s
        summoning has confined Cho''Gath''s presence exclusively to the League of
        Legends.  It is here that summoners use Cho''Gath''s Voidborn abilities to
        help decide the fate of Runeterra.  The Terror of the Void knows what fate
        it would choose for Runeterra, given half the chance.


        Woe betide the day when Cho''Gath grows weary of the League.', quote: '',

    internal_name: Amumu
    lore: {desc: 'Perhaps one of the oddest champions in the League of Legends is
        the yordle known as Amumu. His life before joining the League remains unknown...
        especially to Amumu. All he remembers is that he woke up alone inside a pyramid
        within the Shurima Desert. He was entwined in mummy wrappings and he could
        not feel his heart beat. Furthermore, he felt a deep sadness that he could
        not entirely explain; he knew he missed his parents, though he could not remember
        who they were. Dropping to his knees, Amumu wept into his bandages. No matter
        what he did, it seemed he could never stop his tears or sadness. Eventually
        he stood up, determined to wander the world to discover his past. Amumu traveled
        all across southern Valoran - a feat that is not easily dismissed.


        While Amumu still hasn''t learned much about his past, he has learned a great
        deal about who he has become. He is most assuredly undead, though he harbors
        none of the evil characteristics typical of undead beings. He also seems to
        keep trouble at arm''s length; Amumu was able to traverse all of Southern
        Valoran without so much as a single bad thing happening to him. He was just
        sad, and the people and beings he encountered eventually shared his sadness.
        Ultimately, he made his way north across the Great Barrier to the Institute
        of War, the home of the League. Amumu''s story was compelling to the summoners
        he met there, and they invited him to take part in a League Judgment. His
        success within the League as a champion has given Amumu something he desired:
        a home. With his present (un)life secured, he now hopes the friends he has
        made will help him discover his past.', quote: 'Things are bad when Amumu
        is crying, but they''re much worse when he''s angry.', quote_author: Ezreal}

    lore: {desc: 'Ravaged by Rune Wars long past, the lands south of the Great Barrier
        are wrecked by chaotic magical storms, leaving the grasp of nature''s rule
        tenuous at best. While abnormal flora or fauna are the norm rather than the
        exception in these ruined areas, perhaps none is more curious than the case
        of Rammus. While no one is entirely certain why an armadillo from the Shurima
        Desert crossed the Kumungu Jungle into the Plague Jungles, Rammus made just
        such a journey. There, amongst the twisted vines and festering rot, he came
        across an oddity - a healthy evergreen hedge maze, stretching as far as the
        eye could see. As he explored the maze, something compelled him toward its
        center - a light, a presence of some kind. As he drew closer, the light surged,
        blinding him and knocking him unconscious.


        When he awoke, Rammus'' whole world had changed. The maze had vanished and
        he felt truly cognizant for the first time in his otherwise unremarkable life.
        As his predicament dawned on him, Rammus had a moment of panic. As he trembled,
        the earth around him began to shake, the intensity increasing until he managed
        to steady himself. As the quake receded, Rammus arose and left the Plague
        Jungles in search of others like him. His search brought him across all the
        lands south of the Great Barrier, but everywhere he went, he was unique. The
        hardships of this sojourn inspired him to craft the suit of armor that would
        earn him the title of Armordillo. Rammus'' quest eventually drew him to the
        only place where a sentient armadillo is less than confounding - the League
        of Legends.', quote: 'I''ve seen a lot of things, but this... this is a first.',

    lore: {desc: 'In most lore, the phoenix is a creature of fire that rises from
        its own ashes. What few know, however, is that phoenixes are elemental beings,
        formed by the eternal essences of their native world. Anivia was conceived
        on a world such as this - a being of the coldest winter, a creature of pure
        elemental ice. On her world, Anivia was the protector of the frozen wastes
        and all those with the spirit to endure in such unforgiving places. She was
        consulted as a creature of great wisdom, one who could not die and who had
        seen the world renewed several times. Somehow, Anivia knew that the day would
        come when she would be plucked from her home and pulled across worlds, and
        when that day came, she received the call with grace. Seeing the imbalance
        and injustice on Runeterra, a world lacking elemental protectors, Anivia took
        her place at the League of Legends.


        Since her arrival, the Cryophoenix has chosen to live among the highest peaks
        of the Northern Ironspike Mountains, adjacent to the frozen wastes of Freljord.
        She has openly claimed this territory as her own protectorate. Surprisingly,
        Anivia has struck up a friendship with the yeti of this region - a friendship
        that grows deeper and deeper with each passing moon. She has formed a close
        bond with two League champions: Nunu (and Willump) and the nomad princess
        Ashe. In a move that caught the League by surprise, the Cryophoenix recently
        entreated the summoners of the Institute of War to research a means in bringing
        across others of her elemental fellows. As a champion, Anivia is revered with
        a sense of awe by most, but is not the most popular as most consider her unapproachable.


        Some say the world will end in fire, some in ice. Anivia awaits the inevitable
        latter.', quote: '', quote_author: ''}

    lore: {desc: 'Most would say that death isn''t funny. It isn''t, unless you''re
        Shaco - then it''s hysterical. He is Valoran''s first fully functioning homicidal
        comic; he jests until someone dies, and then he laughs. The figure that has
        come to be known as the Demon Jester is an enigma. No one fully agrees from
        whence he came, and Shaco never offers any details on his own. A popular belief
        is that Shaco is not of Runeterra - that he is a thing summoned from a dark
        and twisted world. Still others believe that he is the demonic manifestation
        of humanity''s dark urges and therefore cannot be reasoned with. The most
        plausible belief is that Shaco is an assassin for hire, left to his own lunatic
        devices until his services are needed. Shaco certainly has proven himself
        to be a cunning individual, evading authorities at every turn who might seek
        him for questioning for some horrendous, law-breaking atrocity. While such
        scuttlebutt might reassure the native inhabitants of Valoran, it seems unimaginable
        that such a malfeasant figure is allowed to remain at large.


        Whatever the truth of his history might be, Shaco has joined the League of
        Legends for reasons only he knows. He is a terrifying figure, typically shunned
        by both his fellow champions and the media at large. Only the summoners in
        the Institute of War know why such a creature was allowed into the League,
        but most Runeterrans suspect it to be a means that allows the power that be
        to keep an eye on the ever-elusive Shaco. Unsurprisingly, this champion is
        popular in places where madness can openly reign, such as among the power-hungry
        summoners of Zaun and Noxus.

    lore: {desc: 'It is said that the man now known as Dr. Mundo was born without
        any sort of conscience.  Instead, he had an unquenchable desire to inflict
        pain through experimentation. By the time he was five, most of the pets in
        the Zaun neighborhood where Mundo grew up had gone missing. By his teenage
        years, his parents were nowhere to be found. By the time he had legally acquired
        his license to practice medicine, he had been acquitted of thirty-eight separate
        charges of murder by the Zaun authorities; the lack of evidence made prosecution
        impossible.


        Dr. Mundo has become equal parts serial killer and mad scientist, though no
        one is entirely sure how his butchery qualifies as science. However, he has
        made tremendous strides in mapping the pain response in the human brain and
        body, going so far as being able to suppress it, even in the most excruciating
        of circumstances. He has also tapped into the primal parts of the brain through
        chemistry, learning how to enhance aggression and adrenaline, as well as dulling
        conscience and the survival instinct. In short, Dr. Mundo''s life''s work
        has been how to create the perfect science-enhanced killer.  Unfortunately,
        the city-state of Noxus regards such behavior as a sign of initiative and
        ambition, rather than inhumanity. Originally fighting for Zaun, Dr. Mundo
        was recruited to also fight for Noxus in the League of Legends; the Madman
        dual faction status represents the fruits of a blossoming relationship between
        Zaun and Noxus. He continues his experiments to this day, even using himself
        as an experimental subject, as evidenced by his disfigured appearance and
        his... unique manner of speaking. There are rumors that the High Command in
        Noxus has given him free reign to pursue his life''s work in his spare time.


        Beware the Madman of Zaun. In his eyes, you are already dead.', quote: '',

    internal_name: Sona
    lore: {desc: 'Sona has no memories of her true parents. As an infant, she was
        found abandoned on the doorstep of an Ionian adoption house, nestled atop
        an ancient instrument in an exquisite case of unknown origins. She was an
        unusually well-behaved child, always quiet and content. Her caretakers were
        sure she would find a home quickly, but it soon became apparent that what
        they mistook for uncommon geniality was actually an inability to speak or
        to produce any sound whatsoever. Sona remained at the adoption house until
        her teens, watching in hopeless silence as prospective adopters passed her
        by. During this time, the caretakers sold her unusual instrument to anxious
        collectors, hoping to build her a trust. For a myriad of bizarre and unexpected
        reasons, however, it would be returned, or simply appear again outside the
        house.


        When a wealthy Demacian woman named Lestara Buvelle learned of the instrument,
        she immediately embarked to Ionia. When the caretakers showcased the instrument
        for her, she rose wordlessly and explored the house, stopping outside Sona''s
        room. Without hesitation, Lestara adopted her and left a generous donation
        for the instrument. With Lestara''s guidance, Sona discovered a deep connection
        with the instrument which Lestara called an ''etwahl''. In her hands, it played
        tones which stilled or quivered the hearts of those around her. Within months,
        she was headlining with the mysterious etwahl for sold-out audiences. She
        played as though plucking heartstrings, effortlessly manipulating the emotions
        of her listeners - all without a single written note. In secret, she discovered
        a potent and deadly use for her etwahl, using its vibrations to slice objects
        from a distance. She honed this discipline in private, mastering her gift.
        When she felt prepared, she went to the only place which could offer her a
        fitting recital: the League of Legends.', quote: 'Her melody moves the soul,

    lore: {desc: 'There is a place between dimensions and between worlds. To some
        it is known as the Outside, to others it is the Unknown. To most, however,
        it is called the Void. Despite its name, the Void is not an empty place, but
        rather the home of unspeakable things, horrors not meant for minds of men.
        Though such knowledge is lost in modern times, there are those who have unwittingly
        discovered what lies beyond, and they have been unable to turn away. Kassadin
        is such a creature. He was once a man forced to look upon the face of the
        Void and forever changed by what he saw. Once a seeker of forbidden knowledge,
        he discovered that what he sought was something else entirely. He is one of
        the few that has found his way to forgotten Icathia and lived to tell the
        tale, following the scant breadcrumbs hidden in ancient texts.


        Within a decaying cyclopean city, Kassadin found secrets of the kind that
        he will never share - secrets that made him quake with fear at the visions
        of things to come that were thrust upon him. The power of the place threatened
        to consume him forever, but Kassadin took the only route available to him
        in order to survive - he let the Void inside him. Miraculously, he was able
        to overcome the alien urges that went with it, and he emerged as something
        more than human. Though a part of him died that day, he knows that he must
        protect Valoran from the things scratching at the door, waiting to get in
        and visit their torments upon the world. They are only one step away... something
        to which the appearance of the abomination known as Cho''Gath attests.


        If you look upon the Void, you can''t put it behind you. If you look upon
        Kassadin, he is probably already there.', quote: '', quote_author: ''}

    lore: {desc: 'The Ionians have developed some of the most breathtaking and deadly
        martial arts on all of Runeterra - just one manifestation of their pursuit
        of enlightenment. The most remarkable blade style to emerge, however, was
        the unusual byproduct of foreign intervention. Master Lito was a swordsman
        whose teachings were sought by ruling classes from nearly every city-state.
        His art was a highly-guarded secret, but it was said that swords would breathe
        in his grasp. He withered unexpectedly from a mysterious disease which baffled
        the brightest of Runeterran physicians. When he died, he left behind Zelos
        and Irelia, his son and daughter, and a truly unique weapon. Zelos became
        a sergeant in the Ionian military and left to seek assistance from Demacia
        immediately prior to Noxus'' invasion of Ionia. Irelia, charged with the protection
        of their home until Zelos returned, was alone when the Noxian forces struck.


        The Ionians fought admirably, but soon Ionian blood stained the land beneath
        the prints of foreign boots. At the Great Stand of the Placidium, Ionians
        prepared for surrender, but were inspired to maintain their resistance when
        the young Irelia lifted her father''s enormous blade and pledged to hold until
        her brother returned. In the chaos of the ensuing fight, Irelia was cursed
        with dark Noxian Necromancy. As her life ebbed, Soraka, the Starchild, made
        a final attempt to anchor her fading soul. Unwilling to relinquish her home,
        Irelia rose at the brink of death, and her father''s sword lifted in the air
        alongside her. Irelia rushed back to the fore, unfazed by the blade''s sudden
        animation. The weapon danced around her effortlessly, cutting down Noxians
        as they gaped in horror. The decimated invaders were forced to retreat from
        the Placidium. Irelia was appointed Ionia''s Captain of the Guard, and when
        the defense of her homeland moved to the Fields of Justice, so did she.',

        that is the city-state of Zaun. Janna eked out what living she could on the
        streets. Life was tough and dangerous for the beautiful young girl, and she
        survived by her wits, and by stealing when wits weren''t enough. The rampant
        magic that characterizes Zaun was the first and most alluring tool which Janna
        realized could both protect and elevate her. Janna discovered that she had
        an affinity for a particular type of magic - the elemental magic of air. She
        mastered her studies of air magic in a matter of months, almost as if she
        was born of it. Janna went from a street vagrant to an avatar of the air virtually
        overnight, stunning and surpassing those who taught her. Such a rapid ascension
        also changed her physical appearance, giving her an otherworldly look.


        Seeking to right the injustice in the world (particularly the insanity that
        has become the city of Zaun), Janna has brought her talents to the League.
        She is a voice for the regulation of magical experimentation and a supporter
        of the development of techmaturgy, making her an indirect ally of the city-state
        of Piltover and the amazing techmaturgical minds that live there. Janna is
        also a new favorite of the League''s many fans. She is often the center of
        attention at functions, fan appreciation days, and other celebratory events.

    lore: {desc: 'Gangplank was born the son of the dread pirate captain Vincent the
        Shadow - one of the most wealthy and feared pirates in all of Blue Flame Island.  One
        might think this would have spoiled the boy with a cushioned life of privilege,
        but the truth is quite the opposite.  Growing up in the city of Bilgewater
        isn''t easy; pirates are not known for their compassion, and that most certainly
        extends to their families.  Vincent wanted his son to grow up tough and strong,
        so he was extremely hard on the young Gangplank.  Even as a child, Gangplank
        was as mean as a snake and is said to have slept with his eyes open.  As he
        grew, the young man rapidly became the most ruthless and feared pirate in
        all of Bilgewater, and his daddy was never more proud than on the day of his
        son''s eighteenth birthday - when Gangplank stabbed his old man in the back
        and claimed the famed pirate ship, the Dead Pool, for his own.


        The continent of Valoran, however, is a dangerous place for pirates; Gangplank
        could read the writing on the wall.  The den of pirates known as Bilgewater
        would soon be pulled down by the undertow of Valoranian politics and the Institute
        of War.  It was time for Bilgewater to have their own champion to represent
        them in the League of Legends, and who better than the fiercest pirate of
        them all?  It is said that Gangplank has enough power and favor to claim the
        title of the Pirate King back home, but that he is simply biding his time
        and building his reputation as a champion before he returns to a life of piracy.

        steal all his booty.', quote: '', quote_author: ''}

    internal_name: Corki
    lore: {desc: 'When Heimerdinger and his yordle colleagues migrated to Piltover,
        they embraced science as a way of life, and they immediately made several
        groundbreaking contributions to the techmaturgical community.  What yordles
        lack in stature, they make up for with industriousness.  Corki, the Daring
        Bombardier, gained his title by test-piloting one of these contributions -
        the original design for the Reconnaissance Operations Front-Line Copter, an
        aerial assault vehicle which has become the backbone of the Bandle City Expeditionary
        Force (BCEF).  Together with his squadron - the Screaming Yipsnakes - Corki
        soars over Valoran, surveying the landscape and conducting aerial acrobatics
        for the benefit of onlookers below.


        Corki is the most renowned of the Screaming Yipsnakes for remaining cool under
        fire and exhibiting bravery to the point of madness.  Before the League, he
        served several tours of duty, often volunteering for missions that would take
        him behind enemy lines, either gathering intelligence or delivering messages
        through hot zones.  He thrived on danger, and enjoyed nothing more than a
        good dogfight in the morning.  More than just an ace pilot, Corki also made
        several modifications to his copter, outfitting it with an arsenal of weapons
        which some speculate were more for show than functionality.  When open hostilities
        ceased as part of the agreement surrounding the formation of the League, Corki
        was forced into a retirement, which he felt "cut the engines and clipped the
        wings".  He tried to make do with stunt flying and canyon running, but it
        was never the same without the refreshing smell of gunpowder streaking through
        the air around him.  When Heimerdinger joined the League of Legends, it was
        no surprise to see Corki follow soon after, eager to test his mettle against
        the best the world has to offer.

    lore: {desc: 'There is a form of magic unknown to many Runeterrans and discredited
        by the few who are even aware of its existence. It is the magic of the earth,
        drawing power from the resonance of crystals and gems. Taric, the Gem Knight,
        is Runeterra''s sole practitioner of this form of magic, having been erratically
        summoned to Runeterra from a faraway world. Back home, Taric''s father was
        a distinguished healer in their home city. Taric was always interested in
        his father''s pursuits, even from a young age. Despite his burgeoning understanding
        of herbs, plants, and animal medicines, it was the power of gems that most
        fascinated the growing boy. It wasn''t long before Taric had exhausted his
        father''s coveted library and set out on a path of his own. He wanted to help
        the people, but not by simply salving their wounds and curing their woes.
        He wasn''t to be a healer, but a defender - one who used the power of earth
        to preserve and protect.


        Taric became a wandering knight, renowned across his homeland as a guardian
        of the just until the day a spell of summoning grabbed him from his home and
        deposited him on Runeterra. Though disoriented and confused at first, he now
        feels that the continent of Valoran is in need of someone like him. Despite
        missing his homeland, Taric is happy to fight in the League, serving as a
        protector for all who seek one. His neat and stylish appearance combined with
        his shiny bejeweled armor and weapons have rapidly made him a celebrity champion
        of the League of Legends. Valoran''s media, for some reason, has taken a great
        interest in his personal life. While open about his life as a champion and
        gracious in all things, Taric is tight-lipped about his life outside the League
        and prefers his privacy.


        As Taric''s father taught him, every stone has its meaning. For Taric''s enemies,
        they all mean trouble.', quote: '', quote_author: ''}

    lore: {desc: 'To most, thoughts of yordles do not conjure images to be feared.
        The easygoing half-pint race, though fierce, is often regarded with some degree
        of joviality. Their high-pitched voices and naturally cute forms inspire something
        of a protective instinct in the larger races, or at least bring to mind images
        of children playing at being adults. Every now and again, however, a yordle
        turns so bad that even at its small stature it strikes terror into the hearts
        of others. Veigar is one such twisted yordle. As a master of the magical black
        arts, as well as a corrupter of cosmic energy, he is one of the most powerful
        sorcerers on Valoran.


        As a child, Veigar was a normal yordle with one small exception - he had a
        deep curiosity for the world beyond Bandle City. The young yordle spent much
        of his time studying the rest of Valoran, and he jumped at the chance to join
        a business that traded with other major city-states. Unfortunately for both
        him and the world, a deal with Noxian trader turned into shady business and
        went bad; Veigar and his companions were subsequently set up to take the fall.
        Arrested by the authorities, he was imprisoned within the walls of Noxus for
        years. Such isolation is very dangerous for yordles - undoubtedly why his
        cruel jailers did such a thing - and Veigar was slowly driven mad.


        He eventually escaped, having become a twisted version of his former self.
        Instead of returning to his people and Bandle City, he sought tutelage from
        dark wizards across the land. With his demented will focused on one task,
        he quickly became a dangerous and powerful wizard in his own right. Now he
        seeks to end all conflict on Valoran by bringing all of the city-states to
        their knees, regardless of their affiliation. The League of Legends is the
        perfect tool to help him meet his ends - for now.

    lore: {desc: 'Trolls have never been well-regarded beings of Valoran. Generally
        speaking, they are barbaric, cannibalistic, and sneaky. They are creatures
        relegated to the murky recesses of the world, hidden away from most intelligent
        beings. Despite their maleficent natures, however, the Ruhgosk never deserved
        the grisly fate that was visited upon them. Generations ago, a twisted necromancer
        known as Hakolin the Bonecrafter attempted to enslave the Ruhgosk tribe. These
        trolls are considerably more genteel than their ill-mannered brethren, although
        still uncouth by human standards. The Ruhgosk fought tooth and claw against
        the necromancer, ultimately driving him from their land. As a parting gift,
        Hakolin afflicted the trolls with a leprous disease, forever cursing the members
        of the tribe. The leprosy would have rotted their flesh away to nothing were
        it not for the trolls'' natural ability to regenerate. Caught forever in a
        hideous rotting state, the Ruhgosk endured their curse while desperately in
        search of a cure. They never found one.


        A wise Ruhgosk shaman learned that he could magically bind the disease to
        a single troll, provided that the troll could bear the weight of the entire
        tribe''s curse upon himself. However, there was no such troll...until the
        birth of Trundle. His ability to regenerate was so profound that it appeared
        as if he did not carry the disease. As Trundle grew, he came to understand
        his gift and what it could do for his people. When he came of age, he took
        the curse from his tribe in a baptism of searing agony. Through the shaman''s
        ritual, Trundle became a horrifying creature whose flesh constantly sloughs
        off his body, only to be re-grown in an unremitting cycle. He has joined the
        League of Legends in hopes of eventually finding someone who could dispel
        the heinous curse completely.', quote: I've learned a thing or two about pain!

    lore: {desc: 'The earliest account of Swain''s existence comes from a Noxian infirmary
        doctor''s notes. According to them, Swain limped into the ward without cry
        or complaint; his right leg was snapped in half, with bone protruding from
        the skin. A small, scowling bird seemed affixed to his shoulder. The doctor
        gawked in horror as the young adolescent answered questions about his health
        and age with a calm, even stare. Even behind the echoing crack as the sand
        counterweights reset his tibia, Swain''s measuring gaze never flickered, nor
        did his eyes twitch from the pop of his fibula. He refused the doctor''s recommendation
        of magical treatment for the leg''s inoperable damage, requesting only a spare
        crutch before shuffling away. He next surfaced in documents from the Noxian
        military, although it is evident that they are incomplete. Normally a crippled
        boy would be turned away in shame from Noxus'' proud legion, but the records
        indicate his first designation was that of a ranking officer.


        The men who''ve served under him (and survived) have remained in his charge
        with unshakable faith and loyalty. He leapt through the High Command''s hierarchy,
        often ascending when superiors requested demotions to join his unit. A cunning
        strategist, Swain was decorated after every battle he fought, regularly hobbling
        in contemplation at the front of the assault. His rise to power seemed unceasing
        until he was suddenly relegated to inactive status prior to the Ionian Invasion
        - a bewildering decision which reeked of bureaucratic subversion. If Swain
        was upset by the events which unfolded, he never belied it. His face was so
        implacable that it was popularly rumored to be a mask, disguising something
        utterly inhuman beneath. More controversy surrounded the bird that never left
        his shoulder, whose name he whispered only to it. When Demacia escalated its
        presence in the League, Swain was immediately returned to active duty.', quote: 'If

        because it has an extraordinarily low crime rate. This hasn''t always been
        the case; brigands and thieves of all sorts used to find the city-state an
        ideal mark for plunder, primarily due to the valuable resources it imports
        to fuel its techmaturgical research. Some even theorize that it would have
        fallen long ago to the chaos of organized crime if not for Caitlyn, the Sheriff
        of Piltover. Born the daughter of a wealthy statesman and a pioneering hextech
        researcher, Caitlyn discovered her natural gift for investigation when, at
        age 14, her father was assaulted and robbed on his way home. She snuck out
        of her house that night with her father''s rifle and tracked down the muggers
        from the crime scene. At first, her parents did their best to discourage her
        from such risky hobbies, but she was incorrigible. Wishing to protect her
        daughter in the only way she knew how, Caitlyn''s mother began outfitting
        her with techmaturgical devices tailored to her sleuthing needs.


        Caitlyn quickly gained notoriety, both because she was single handedly defeating
        crime in Piltover and also because she soon developed into a ravishing beauty.
        She never backed down from a case or a challenge, and she was one of the sharpest
        shots in the city-state. Her services were soon requested by Demacia to help
        track down a mysterious outlaw who had begun committing high-profile heists.
        The bandit, who always left a card with an ornate ''C'' at the scene of the
        crime, became Caitlyn''s arch-nemesis. To this day, Caitlyn still searches
        for this cat burglar, and the chase has led her all across Valoran. She has
        joined the League to hone her skills and gain the influence necessary to track

    lore: {desc: 'The city of Zaun is a place where both magic and science have gone
        awry. The unchecked nature of experimentation has taken its toll on the city.  However,
        Zaun''s lenient restrictions allow their researchers and inventors the leeway
        to push the bounds of science at an accelerated rate, for better or worse.  It
        was under these conditions that a team of doctoral students from Zaun''s College
        of Techmaturgy made a breakthrough in the field of intelligent steam automation.  Their
        creation, the steam golem Blitzcrank, was developed to exercise judgment on-the-fly
        in order to assist with Zaun''s hazardous waste reclamation process, since
        so often the conditions did not allow for human supervision.  However, he
        soon began exhibiting unforeseen behaviors.


        Over time, the scientists were able to identify a demonstrated learning process,
        and Blitzcrank fast became a celebrity.  As is sadly often the case though,
        credit for the golem''s creation was scooped up by another - Professor Stanwick
        Pididly - though most now know the truth.  In the wake of the ensuing legal
        maelstrom, it became evident that neither party truly had the steam golem''s
        best interests at heart, and Blitzcrank humbly petitioned for personal autonomy.  Backed
        by overwhelming support from the public, it took the liberal Council of Zaun
        only a few weeks to declare Blitzcrank a fully-independent, sentient entity.  A
        unique being, the golem left Zaun, distressed by the controversy and feeling
        there was no place he could fit in.  His travels led him to the one location
        in Valoran where unique beings have a place - the League of Legends.  Fortunately,
        he was easily able to adapt his design to suit the rigors he would face on
        the Fields of Justice.


        Though Blitzcrank may batter anything that stands in his way, he really has
        a heart of gold...encased in a framework of iron...in a carapace of steel.',

    lore: {desc: 'There is a world of perfect harmony, where all are part of the whole.
        The Monolith is the essence of all creation, and its denizens are but singular
        pieces of it. It is beautiful in its symmetry, and in its almost complete
        lack of uncertainty. The rocky beings that live there know their place and
        work to fulfill their duties to the fullest extent, functioning almost as
        a superorganism or hive. Malphite has always strived to live up to his full
        potential, as his own personal part of the whole, serving the role of a distinguished
        creature questing to enforce his people''s flawless vision of order.


        One day, without warning, a dimensional rift opened, and he was summoned across
        the cosmos to the world of Runeterra. The transition was painful and terrifying
        for him, as he was cut off from the song of his people and the Monolith -
        things that had been ever-present in him since the day he was born. He raged,
        trapped in the Summoning Circle, as those who had called him made their plea.
        Runeterra was a world that had nearly been consumed by its disharmony. It
        was a world that needed champions to bring order out of chaos. It was to that
        end that the rock-creature was summoned, so that he could aid them in this
        quest. Looking past his own fear and apprehension, Malphite could see that
        this was a respectable goal, and one in which he could participate - perhaps
        uniquely so. Today, as part of the League of Legends, he hammers those who
        would seek to upset Valoran''s movement toward order, especially turning his
        attention to those that wield chaotic magic. Unfortunately, Malphite has also
        begun to change, as he has been forced to face his own profound loneliness
        among the world''s vibrant individuality.

    lore: {desc: 'Driven by an intense killer instinct, Katarina uses her talents
        as an assassin for the glory of Noxus, and the continued elevation of her
        family. While her fervor drives her to ever-greater feats, it can sometimes
        lead her astray.


        From childhood, Katarina displayed a natural gift for combat. As the daughter
        of a prominent Noxian general many paths were open to her, but she rejected
        them all for the path of the blade. Rigorously trained by the finest assassins
        in Noxus, her father the best among them, it was not long before Katarina
        demanded her first assignment. The task they gave her was aggravatingly simple:
        assassinate a low-ranking Demacian officer. As she set to her work infiltrating
        the enemy camp, Katarina discovered an opportunity too tantalizing to pass
        by - the arrival of a Demacian General. Stalking him to his tent, she quietly
        dispatched his guards and slit his throat. Pleased with her impressive kill,
        she disappeared into the night. Katarina''s elation faded the next day when
        her original objective, the Demacian officer, led his forces to ambush unprepared
        Noxian soldiers. Though the Noxians fought valiantly, they suffered heavy
        casualties. Furious at her mistake, Katarina set off to complete her original
        task. Returning to the camp, she spied her now heavily guarded target and
        realized a stealthy kill was no longer possible. Drawing her blades, Katarina
        swore the officer would die, no matter the cost. She leapt into battle, unleashing
        a whirlwind of steel. One by one blades flashed and guards fell, each strike
        bringing her one step closer to the officer. A final thrown dagger restored
        her honor. Bloody and bruised, Katarina barely escaped the Demacian forces,
        and returned to Noxus a changed woman. The scar she earned that night now
        serves as a constant reminder that she must never let passion interfere with
        duty.', quote: Never question my loyalty. You will never know what I endure

    lore: {desc: 'Before Nocturne, people believed that dreams were figments of their
        imagination, meaningless images that flashed through the mind when one slept.
        This belief was put to the test when a rash of sleep-related incidents started
        afflicting summoners of the League. Some would wake up screaming, terrified
        and beyond consolation. Some could not fall asleep, slowly going mad as the
        nights ticked by. Some simply never woke up. Physicians were baffled until
        a Field Architect happened to pass out next to a nexus on Twisted Treeline.
        Witnesses said he cried out once and then stopped breathing. Immediately after,
        magical energy arced out from the nexus, and Nocturne appeared.


        Nocturne did not take his introduction to this world kindly. He slaughtered
        everything he could find before summoners were able to magically confine him.
        After a period of intense study, League experts divined that Nocturne hunted
        summoners in their sleep, attacking them in a place where their magic was
        useless. This seemed to be his only purpose. The families of the victims demanded
        justice, but League officials were concerned that death might only return
        Nocturne to the place from which he came. They bound him to a nexus fragment,
        trapping him in the physical world. As punishment for his crimes, they allowed
        summoners to call upon Nocturne in the League matches, bending his will to
        the summoners he hates and creating his own personal nightmare. League scholars
        don''t know whether he truly came from the plane of dreams, or whether there
        are any more like him. Some theorize that the summoning act affected summoners''
        subconscious minds, luring Nocturne to them in their sleep. Perhaps the most
        disturbing theory is that Nocturne is a person''s nightmare come to life.
        If this is true, they wonder, who is the dreamer?', quote: The darkness is

    lore: {desc: 'The twisting magical energies unleashed by mages during the Rune
        Wars caused an incredible amount of devastation to the natural world.  The
        League was established to control the use of this magic by confining it to
        the Fields of Justice.  By limiting its use to there, they thought that they
        could prevent it from doing further harm to the environment.  It seemed that
        they were successful until Maokai came into being.  During a League match
        on The Twisted Treeline, Maokai, an ancient oak that stood above the upper
        jungle, spontaneously roared to life.  Ripped from the natural balance by
        arcane forces, his sentience was forged in chaos.  Before the Adjudicators
        of the League could step in and suppress him, he slew all six champions participating
        in the match.  The scholars of the Arcanum Majoris took a keen interest in
        him, as they were eager to discover the secrets of his animation.


        Maokai was furious, however.  He abhorred the existence that was thrust upon
        him; he felt it was a corruption of nature.  He learned to communicate with
        people in hopes of finding a way to be returned to his former, true state.  Seizing
        the opportunity, the League offered a trade.  They would research a way to
        revert him so long as he agreed to fight in the League of Legends.  Maokai
        was indifferent to verdicts rendered by the League, but he was eager to punish
        summoners for their wanton use of magic.  He agreed to the terms under one
        condition: once they learned how to turn him back, they would never animate
        another tree again.  He wears a lantern on the Fields of Justice to set him
        apart from the other trees, and as a warning to the animals that would do
        him harm.', quote: I will use this power until I am free of it., quote_author: Maokai}

    lore: {desc: 'On a faraway world, Renekton was born a member of a race of bestial
        guardians created to serve as the rulers and protectors of their people. Alongside
        his brother Nasus, Renekton oversaw the upkeep of the Great Library, which
        served as both a vault of ancient knowledge and the repository of the teachings
        of the Cycle of Life and Death. While the enlightened Nasus taught those scholars
        who came to study, Renekton served as the Great Library''s gatekeeper. He
        could sense the true natures of those who sought Nasus'' teachings, and he
        sent away those with dark ambitions. Over time, however, his repeated exposure
        to this evil infected his mind. He grew furious with the malevolence in the
        hearts of men, and as he descended deeper into madness, he discovered he could
        quell the fury by cutting the evil from the men who possessed it. Unfortunately,
        the relief was as short-lived as the subjects, and the "butcher''s rage",
        as it came to be known, would resurge even stronger.


        Consumed by his anger, Renekton turned on the one being who could defeat him
        -- his own brother. Nasus pleaded with Renekton to see reason. Realizing that
        he was beyond redemption, the despondent Nasus valiantly struck down his wayward
        sibling. Defenseless, Renekton waited eagerly for death''s release. It never
        came. He was spared when summoners from the League of Legends claimed his
        brother. Caught in the wake of this powerful spell, Renekton tumbled for what
        seemed like ages between realities. When he finally emerged, he fell deep
        into the sewers of Zaun. Insane with fury, Renekton languished in his newfound
        home, driven senseless by his rage. That is until, by happenstance, he caught
        a familiar scent in the air. Believing that the familiar scent would guide
        him to the solace that was fading from his memory, he traced his brother to
        the Institute of War.', quote: 'My brother has become hollow. Full of rage,
        but empty.', quote_author: 'Nasus, the Curator of the Sands.'}

        line have spent their lives waging war against any who opposed Demacian ethics.
        It is said that every Lightshield is born with anti-Noxian sentiment in his
        blood. Jarvan IV is no exception, even though he is the first Lightshield
        born to the age of the League of Legends. As his forefathers had before him,
        he led Demacian troops into bloody engagements with Noxian forces, and on
        many occasions he has bled alongside wounded allies and fallen comrades. In
        his most crushing defeat, he was outmaneuvered and captured by a Noxian battalion
        under the command of Jericho Swain. This mistake nearly cost him his life
        at the hands of Urgot, but he was rescued by the Dauntless Vanguard, an elite
        Demacian strike force led by Jarvan''s childhood companion, Garen.


        Those close to him believed that his capture changed him. Xin Zhao was quoted
        as saying: "His eyes never seemed to look at you, only through you to something
        he could not look away from." One day, without warning, Jarvan IV handpicked
        a squad of Demacian soldiers and left Demacia, vowing to find "atonement".
        He began by tracking and hunting the most dangerous beasts and bandits he
        could find in northern Valoran, but he soon tired of such prey. Seeking something
        that only he understood, he ventured south of the Great Barrier. He wasn''t
        heard from again for nearly two years. After many had assumed the worst, he
        returned to glorious fanfare on the streets of Demacia. His Demacian plates
        were adorned with the bones and scales of creatures unknown. His eyes bore
        the wisdom of someone twice his age. Of the twelve soldiers who had departed
        with him, only two returned. In a tone as cold and steady as steel, he swore
        to bring the enemies of Demacia to their knees.', quote: 'There is only one

        and greedy alike into her web of deceit. While her victims may discover her
        true intentions, no one has ever lived to reveal what dark secrets lie behind
        her enigmatic guise.


        In dark halls, hidden from society, Elise preached the word of a mythical
        spider god. Her desperate followers hungered for the god''s favor, believing
        its blessings to be the source of Elise''s vibrance and power. When Elise
        proclaimed that she would lead a pilgrimage to the spider god''s shrine, she
        selected only her most devout disciples to join her. Ecstatic, the chosen
        few followed her blindly as she led them on a perilous journey across the
        sea. When they came ashore at their final destination, the mysterious Shadow
        Isles, Elise led them to a cavern shrouded in webs. Expecting a shrine, the
        group looked to their priestess in confusion. She turned to the crowd and
        raised her arms in triumph, revealing strange, spiderlike legs that grew out
        of her back. Seeing her terrifying true form for the first time, Elise''s
        followers turned to flee, but she conjured magical webs to trap them. With
        her victims ensnared, she turned to face the cave and uttered a screeching
        cry. An enormous undead spider-beast emerged from the darkness, dragging its
        hideous bulk on thick, pointed legs. Elise''s followers could only scream
        as the monstrous spider ate them alive. She approached the sated creature,
        extracted its venom, and drank the strange substance. An immediate sense of
        rejuvenation flowed through her veins. With mortality delayed once again,
        Elise left to rejoin her congregation. They were overjoyed to hear that their
        fellows had chosen to remain at the spider god''s sacred home. Elise reassured
        her disciples that she would lead another pilgrimage in due time. The spider
        god would be waiting.', quote: The truly faithful need not fear the spider's

    lore: {desc: 'There once was a Piltovian man named Corin Reveck who had a daughter
        named Orianna, whom he loved more than anything else in the world. Though
        Orianna had incredible talent for dancing, she was deeply fascinated by the
        champions of the League of Legends. This fascination compelled her to begin
        training to become such a champion. It is unfortunate that her sheltered,
        wide-eyed naivete led her to take unnecessary and dangerous chances which
        ultimately led to her tragic demise. Orianna''s death shattered Corin, driving
        him into deep depression and an obsession with techmaturgy. He could not stand
        the void his daughter''s death left in his life, so he decided to build a
        replacement - one that would complete Orianna''s dream of joining the League.
        What was created is the clockwork killing machine that Corin named after his
        daughter. Knowing that she was destined to be a champion and seeing the way
        the times were changing, he created The Ball as her pet and protector. This
        nearly symbiotic creation uses a different type of techmaturgy, relying more
        heavily on electricity than clockwork.


        Orianna and The Ball now fight as Champions in the League of Legends, using
        her sometimes misguided morality as a compass. She tries in earnest to fit
        in with those around her.  However, no matter how hard she tries, Orianna
        can never be human and there is always something unnerving and alien about
        her. Though she attempts social interaction with other champions in the League
        of Legends, there are few who can get past her exotic nature. To many, it''s
        as if there''s nothing inside, that Orianna is just a soulless clockwork shell
        - a dangerous and deadly one at that. However, all along she remains the perfect
        daughter in her father''s eyes.', quote: 'Dance with me, my pet. Dance with

    lore: {desc: 'During the chaos of the Rune Wars, an enormous runestone was lost
        deep within the Plague Jungles. It remained there, untouched for centuries,
        emanating a potent magic which infused nearby wildlife with sentience and
        vitality. A group of monkeys who were particularly empowered by it came to
        worship the stone, and their leader - a wise sage - became convinced that
        he could harness its power to make the monkeys immortal. He performed an elaborate
        ritual, but things didn''t go as he expected. The runestone was destroyed,
        and instead of granting immortality, it produced Kong, a monkey who carried
        in his heart the strength and power it had contained. Kong was driven by an
        unquenchable desire for greatness. He sought out every beast and monster the
        Plague Jungles could offer, eager to find a worthy opponent, but none offered
        the challenge he craved. He asked the sage for advice, and learned about a
        legend of hairless monkeys to the north who, with wits and might, had bent
        the world to their will.


        Wukong left, journeying north, determined to discover if the legend was true.
        He crossed the Southern Wastes and then the Great Barrier. On his way, he
        happened upon Master Yi, who was deep in meditation. Kong asked him who the
        strongest warrior in the north was, and Yi told him about the League of Legends.
        The tale intoxicated Kong, a place where he could battle the strongest fighters
        in the world was, to him, paradise. Kong asked Yi to introduce him to this
        League, and to teach him the ways of humans, so that he could be a fitting
        champion. In return, he would honor Yi by using Yi''s Wuju style to become
        the greatest warrior Runeterra had ever seen. Admiring his passion, Yi agreed,
        but under the condition that Kong would one day teach the lessons of Wuju
        to a pupil of his own. In the spirit of this agreement, he renamed Kong "Wukong,"
        and gave him a weapon suited to his unusual nature - an enchanted staff that
        the young Doran had crafted. The weapon was an unrivalled masterpiece. Guided
        by Yi, Wukong joined the League of Legends to prove himself as the best, and
        to show the world the true power of Wuju.', quote: Only in combat do you learn

    lore: {desc: 'In a faraway place known as Lokfar there was a seafaring marauder
        called Kegan Rodhe. As was his people''s way, Kegan sailed far and wide with
        his fellows, stealing treasures from those unlucky enough to catch their attention.
        To some, he was a monster; to others, just a man. One night, as they sailed
        through the arctic waters, strange lights danced over the frozen wastes. There
        was something hypnotic about them; it was something that drew them to it like
        moths to a flame. Trekking across the frozen waste, they came to a cave covered
        in ancient runes. The meaning of the runes long lost to them, Kegan led the
        way inside. There, inside a perfect cage of ice floated a dancing column of
        flame. There was no way such a thing should be burning, especially not in
        this place. However, its movement was as hypnotic as a siren''s song, captivating
        and seductive. While the others stayed back, Kegan could not help but approach
        it while holding out his hand...


        That is the last thing Kegan Rodhe remembers, for now his body belongs to
        Brand. It is a creature of olden times, perhaps even a casualty of the Rune
        Wars. It is known in ancient texts as the Burning Vengeance. It is a creature
        of pure fiery hate that exists for no other reason than to lay waste the world
        of men and yordles. No one is quite sure how Brand found his way to Valoran,
        but he began his predations at once. Overcome by Demacian forces, he was given
        a choice: fight within the confines of the League or die. Naturally, he chose
        to use his destructive powers in the League, for now...', quote: 'This place

        will and dedication were unmatched by any of his peers, and his skill drew
        the attention of Reginald Ashram, the League''s High Councilor at the time.
        While studying at the Arcanum Majoris, Lee Sin became frustrated with instruction
        paced for the other students. He spent his free time researching the nuances
        of summoning in hopes of graduating sooner. He made amazing advances in his
        arcane studies, surpassing all other students. By all indications, he would
        have become one of the League''s greatest summoners were it not for one terrible
        mistake. Too impatient, he attempted to test his ability by summoning a beast
        from the Plague Jungles. What he summoned instead was a young boy, but not
        in one piece. He barely had time to look the boy in what was once his face
        before the jumbled human mass fell lifeless to the floor. A League investigation
        later revealed that the boy''s entire village was obliterated by feedback
        from the ritual.


        Lee Sin''s talents were so promising that the League was willing to overlook
        the incident, but he could never forgive himself. He left the Institute and
        journeyed to the Shojin Monastery for eternal repentance, swearing never to
        practice magic again. Years later, hoping to atone for his crime with martyrdom,
        he set himself ablaze as a protest of the Noxian occupation of Ionia. He remained
        alive in this state, enduring searing agony for weeks. His actions paved the
        way for a League match wherein Ionia prevailed, but by the time he was doused,
        his eyes had been burned completely from their sockets. Hailed as a savior,
        he was reborn, and his will to act invigorated. He joined the League of Legends
        to continue his atonement with sweat and blood, a true monk''s only possessions.',

    lore: {desc: 'The world is not always as civilized as people might think. There
        are still those who would follow the blackest paths of magic and become corrupted
        by the darker powers that flow through Runeterra. Shauna Vayne knows this
        fact well. As a young privileged girl in the heart of Demacia''s elite, her
        father tried to convince her of the constabulary''s ever-vigilant eye. Young
        and naive, she truly believed that her world was one of perfect safety, until
        one night, when a twisted witch took interest in her father. The malevolent
        woman overcame her father''s conciliar guard, then tortured her family before
        murdering them. The young Shauna escaped only by hiding herself and then fleeing
        once the hag had departed, plagued by the screams of her loved ones as she
        ran. A burning hatred was born in her that day, one that could never be denied.


        Vayne was able to take care of herself using her father''s money, and she
        began to train as soon as an instructor would have her as a student. By the
        time she was a fully grown woman, she had become a grim warrior. However,
        the fields of battle were not to be her home. Demacia needed a protector,
        one who hunted those lost to the darkness. Shauna used her family''s contacts
        to become the first Night Hunter, and now her prowess is the stuff of legends.
        It is said that those who practice the black arts quake when they hear that
        the Night Hunter is on the prowl. Despite her crusade, Shauna has looked at
        the League of Legends in horror. There are champions who have clearly lost
        themselves to the blackest of magics, and who have been embraced within the
        League even though they should be put down for the safety of all. The time
        has come for the Night Hunter to execute her secret mission - to purge the
        League of Legends.

        for getting even, no matter who crossed him. This made him something of a
        loner, but he didn''t mind. He liked to tinker, preferring the company of
        gadgets, and he could usually be found rummaging through the junkyard. He

    lore: {desc: 'Centuries ago, there lived a race of creatures as ferocious as they
        were wise. The Brackern were unusual beings blessed with the earth''s primal
        magic, embodied in the form of crystals. Their kind knew of an arcane ritual
        to bind their life''s essence to a crystal, communing with the magic embedded
        in it. With this power, the Brackern thrived in the Odyn Valley, protecting
        both creatures and crystals alike. Despite attacks from those looking to claim
        the primal magic, it seemed that nothing could get past the Brackern''s defenses.
        Nothing, that is, until the devastation of a Rune War.


        A vicious battle was fought near the Odyn Valley and the unleashed chaotic
        magic poisoned the crystals. The Brackern began to grow sick and die, and
        no amount of defensive magic could reverse the effects. To avoid extinction,
        their only course was to hibernate underground until the wars stopped. The
        strongest, most intelligent Brackern hibernated closer to the surface to awaken
        first and assess the world''s condition for the return of their race. The
        recent mining operations and violent escalation in Kalamanda were enough to
        awaken the first of these vanguards. When Skarner burst to the surface, he
        lashed out in anger and confusion. Reason eventually won out over his anger
        when he realized that the agents of the League who found him were simply functionaries.
        Skarner was invited to the Institute of War to share the Brackern''s story.
        In return, the summoners told him about the history that his kind had slept
        through. Much had been done to curb the unchecked use of magic since the Rune
        Wars, but it was obvious that the world was not yet safe for his kind to reawaken.
        For now, however, there is a place where Skarner can use his power to change
        the world into one to which his kind could eventually return: the League of
        Legends.', quote: The humans have not yet learned to control their magic -
        what once was Kalamanda is now a crystal scar on the history of this world.,

        of science was something Heimerdinger could not resist.  By the time he''d
        completed his third doctorate, he had already become the greatest of all yordle
        scientists and there was little his home could still offer him.  The great
        academies of Piltover far to the north called to him, daring him to make his
        mark in the City of Progress.  Knowing he would never thrive away from his
        own kind, Heimerdinger gathered like-minded yordles to join him in his quest,
        thus forming the backbone of the now famous Yordle Academy of Science & Progress.  Since
        then, he has become one of the most respected minds of the modern age and
        his academy is one of the leading institutions in all of Valoran.


        Heimerdinger has pioneered many new scientific achievements, delving deeper
        and deeper into the field of techmaturgy, including the development of the
        now ubiquitous star-rods that light many of the streets of the city-states.  However,
        there is something strange about the Revered Inventor.  In his quest to expand
        knowledge, he underwent an experiment of his own design to allow him to use
        a greater portion of his brain simultaneously.  It most certainly worked,
        but at an unusual cost - Heimerdinger''s brain increased in size.  His head
        changed along with it and now the great scientist looks like a yordle with
        a giant brain-shaped head.  Heimerdinger has turned his attentions to the
        current state of war on Valoran, however, and works to rectify what he considers
        is an unacceptable situation.  Heimerdinger believes that science is the key
        to saving the world.  Much more, he has rolled up his sleeves and is out to
        prove this as a member of the League of Legends - most definitely as the League''s
        smartest champion!

    lore: {desc: 'The enigmatic creature known as Nasus came to the League from a
        faraway world, and served as part of a vast and learned desert empire. There
        he was a respected and enlightened individual, having been made the Keeper
        of the Great Library. However, he was also part of a race of animalistic creatures
        that served as the rulers and protectors of the people. Unfortunately, there
        were others of his kind that believed they were more than protectors. They
        were under the egotistical delusion that they had ascended to become gods.
        War on Nasus''s world was never more than a breath away, as these deluded
        others sought to enslave the people and establish a totalitarian sovereignty.
        In the midst of a heated battle, just as Nasus was about to slay his treacherous
        brother Renekton, he was pulled through the cosmos to a summoning circle in
        Runeterra.


        At first angered that he had been taken just as he was about to cripple the
        enemies of his people, Nasus'' advanced intellect won out when he heard the
        pleas of mercy from the summoners. He learned that Runeterra was also filled
        with its own brand of injustice. This danger was no less threatening than
        what he had fought against at home, and champions were needed to protect the
        people of this world. Heeding the call, Nasus chose to take his place in the
        League of Legends, knowing that his brothers and sisters would carry on the
        fight back home. These days, he is the Curator of the Sands, feeling most
        at home in the crumbling ruins of the Shurima Desert. However, recent disturbing
        news has reached the Keeper''s ears - rumors that perhaps his brother had
        not in fact been left behind. If this were the case, the destruction of Renekton
        would quickly become Nasus'' main priority, before this world too faces the
        threats of his brother''s forked tongue and endless ambition.


        The Curator of the Sands, though contemplative, is not to be trifled with.',

    lore: {desc: 'There are few dwellers, let alone champions, residing in the blasted
        and dangerous lands that lie south of the Great Barrier. Much of that world
        still bears the scars of past Runes Wars, especially the mysterious Kumungu
        Jungle. There are long-forgotten treasures in these strange places which many
        risk life and limb to acquire. The champion known as Nidalee was only a young
        girl travelling with her treasure-seeking parents when they lost their way
        in the dense, rainy jungles. The jungle was unforgiving, and she watched her
        parents suffer agonizing final days as they fell victim to a mysterious and
        vicious disease.


        As improbable as it was for a child to survive in the inhospitable jungle
        by herself, she did just that. Her youthful innocence and a fortunate naivete
        caused her to appeal to the beasts of that place and she was taken in by a
        family of cougars and raised as one of their own. She grew and somehow absorbed
        the raw magic of the dense wilds, evolving beyond both her human physiology
        and her feline affectation. On one pivotal day in her life, standing over
        the torn remnants of a Noxian squad of woodcutters, Nidalee chose to rejoin
        the so-called civilized world, to fight in the League of Legends so as to
        protect the vast woods from both Demacia and Noxus.


        Nidalee was taught to fight by her feline family, battling viciously with
        tooth and nail. Something in her feline ways may draw you to her, but remember

        the most devout proponents of enlightenment and harmony...but as is always
        the case, there are those who follow a very different path.  Born in a grassy
        clearing under a red moon, Udyr has always been compelled by the primal drive
        within him.  His will was not untempered, simply undomesticated.  As a boy,
        he toiled on his father''s farm, but he felt a much deeper connection with
        the mustangs that would graze in the distant fields than with the townsfolk
        who would visit.  Oftentimes he was dragged into the house at night with a
        swat and a scolding when his parents would find him sleeping beneath the stars.


        On the day of his sixteenth birthday, Udyr bade his family farewell and struck
        a path to the east, determined to shed the trappings of "civilized" society.  Freed
        of the shackles of cultural expectations, Udyr tapped into a well of inner
        ferocity he hadn''t known before.  His feral senses roiled to the surface
        and he let them overcome him.  It was at this point in his life that Udyr
        truly lost his humanity.  Poachers and travelers who entered his territory
        did so at terrible risk, and rarely managed to leave it.


        A monk on a long journey passed through his woods one day, and Udyr decided
        to scare him, leaping from a nearby brush.  The monk casually turned and redirected
        Udyr to one side.  Udyr, enraged, tried time and time again to best him, but
        the monk was unassailable.  When Udyr was exhausted, the monk wordlessly beckoned
        him to follow, and together they walked in silence to the Hirana Monastery.  The
        monks there took him in, and taught him to harness and control his animalistic

    lore: {desc: 'While other young yordle girls played skip-step and braided wreathes
        out of posies, Poppy spent her youth earning calluses and grease stains in
        her father''s armor shop.  Blomgrun, her father, was Bandle City''s finest
        smith.  The only thing he loved as much as his work was his young daughter,
        Poppy - named for the sprightly sounds of the sparks that leapt from his ever-burning
        forge.  He welled with pride the day she was first able to lift his trusty
        hammer, Whomper.  Poppy immediately took to his art, demonstrating a natural
        gift for smithing, which Blomgrun honed with devoted instruction.


        One day, a Demacian general named Florin Berell commissioned Blomgrun to craft
        a helm, glorious beyond comparison.  Blomgrun toiled away on this project,
        determined to present Florin with his finest work.  He let Poppy set the center
        jewel, entrusting her with the most important piece.  When the pair finished,
        they departed for Demacia to deliver it in person.  Word of the general''s
        order, however, was leaked to the Noxian High Command, and two Noxian assassins
        were dispatched to intercept the delivery.  Blomgrun was able to occupy the
        assassins long enough for Poppy to escape with the prized helm.  She watched
        helplessly from the brush as her father was slain.  Instead of fleeing home,
        she carried the helm the rest of the way to Demacia alone.  She refused payment
        for it, saying that no amount would compensate for her father''s life.  Instead,
        she offered it as a gift, honoring her father''s final intentions.  Florin
        saw the grim determination behind the tears in her eyes, and requested that
        the leadership of Bandle City appoint Poppy as the yordle ambassador to Demacia.  Soon
        after, seeking to crush Noxus with her father''s hammer, Poppy volunteered
        for the League of Legends.

    lore: {desc: 'The foothills of the Great Barrier are home to the hardiest people
        found anywhere on Valoran. Only those with great fortitude and endurance dwell
        in what is perhaps the most rugged and unforgiving environment anywhere on
        the face of Runeterra. It is here that the mighty Gragas keeps permanent residence,
        living south of Noxus. This behemoth of a man has long eschewed the rigors
        of civilization for what he calls his "slice of paradise;" he has no neighbors
        to bother him and plenty of space to pursue his life''s ambition - brewing.  Grogs,
        ales, meads, and wine - nothing is beyond his skill to brew. What makes Gragas
        a truly special brewmaster, however, is his proximity to a large and powerful
        nexus.


        The magic of this nexus has seeped into his fermented creations, and Gragas
        has consumed enough of his own poison over the years to slake the thirst of
        an army. This arcane alcohol has caused Gragas to swell both in height and
        girth; he looms over the tallest of men and boasts nearly twice their width.
        To complement his immoderate size, Gragas has developed an ornery temper -
        one fueled by liquor and raw magic. His infrequent sojourns into Noxus for
        supplies always unfold the same way: Gragas enters a Noxian tavern, Gragas
        gets into several fights, Gragas lays out countless citizens, and finally
        Gragas flees for the foothills with Noxian constables in hot - though reluctant
        - pursuit. His misadventures have garnered him the attention of several summoners
        in the League of Legends, and he is now a willing champion in the arenas...doling
        out hard liquor and harder fists.

    lore: {desc: 'Far above the clouds on Mount Targon resides a stalwart tribe of
        people known as the Rakkor who still revere combat and war as ultimate artforms.
        They remember the Rune Wars of Runeterra and know that the League of Legends
        can only repress the rising tides of violence for so long. Each member of
        the tribe is bred to be a disciplined and vicious warrior, preferring to battle
        soldiers of either the Noxian or Demacian armies only when outnumbered at
        least ten to one. Rakkor warriors are trained not only to be as lethal with
        their bare hands as the most capable martial artists, but also to fiercely
        wield the many relic-weapons of the tribe. Such treasures have been handed
        down from generation to generation, and have harnessed the mystical nature
        of Runeterra in their very cores.  These relic-weapons are among the most
        dangerous in existence - and it comes as no surprise that they have found
        their way to the League of Legends in the hands of Pantheon.


        This stone-faced warrior is a paragon of his people, his very existence an
        anthem of exultation to the art of combat. Pantheon found it insulting that
        the people of Valoran would install an organization to replace war, complete
        with so-called champions, without including the Rakkor. Gathering the blessings
        of his tribe and armed with the relics of his ancestors, he has descended
        on the League to show the world a true warrior. He cares not who he fights,
        and cares nothing for the pageantry or prestige of a League champion, but
        lives only for the austere glory of battle.  As long as Pantheon breathes,
        he thirsts for another foe to vanquish.', quote: I was hoping they had more

    lore: {desc: 'Ezreal was born with the gift of magic flowing through his veins.
        Ezreal, however, was also born with a much stronger sense of wanderlust. Put
        into school to become a skilled techmaturgist, Ezreal quickly became bored
        with magical studies. By the time the boy genius was eight years old, he had
        fully mapped out the underground tunnels of Piltover. The quality of his work
        was so great that the government of Piltover purchased his maps and salaried
        his services as Piltover''s Grandmaster Explorer. This sealed the deal on
        Ezreal''s path in life - he would eschew the arcane arts in favor of archaeology.
        Since then, countless of Ezreal''s adventures have been written about as romanticized
        stories.


        One of Ezreal''s latest adventures, however, has brought him face-to-face
        with his other legacy - his latent magical power. While exploring the pyramids
        of Shurima Desert, Ezreal uncovered an amulet of incredible power. Aside from
        the sheer size of the amulet (it was made for a being easily twice Ezreal''s
        size), it allows the wielder to control and shape magical energy - provided
        a source of magic is in the vicinity. This allowed Ezreal to tap into his
        natural talent for magic without having to put any serious effort into it
        - a big win for the Prodigal Explorer. The drawback is that for some unknown
        reason, the amulet is attuned with summoning magic. Without warning, Ezreal
        may find himself acting as a champion for, as he puts it, "a summoner hell-bent
        on resolving some irrelevant world-shattering League conflict." Still, Ezreal
        feels being summoned into a Field of Justice on occasion is a small price
        to pay.


        "There''s little time to study musty tomes when you''re busy crawling around
        where the musty tomes originally came from." Such is Ezreal''s credo.', quote: '',

    lore: {desc: 'The work of gravediggers is essential amongst the living, but invaluable
        in the Shadow Isles. There are many shades of death there, and each is embraced
        rather than feared or reviled. One can only ascend from one state to the next
        with the magical aid of a skilled professional. At the end of the first Rune
        War, Yorick Mori made his living as a gravedigger. His family owned and maintained
        the Final Rest Memorial, one of the oldest cemeteries in Valoran. The shovel
        he employed for his work had been passed down for generations. Each gravedigger
        taught his son that this shovel was imbued with the spirit of every forefather,
        and that those spirits would protect him during the long lonely nights amongst
        the tombstones. To his eternal regret, Yorick died without an heir, bringing
        the proud Mori line to a close. His body was interred with his shovel in the
        family mausoleum, and the Final Rest Memorial soon fell to ruin. Death, however,
        was not the end Yorick had expected.


        Yorick emerged on the haunted shores of the Shadow Isles - not quite dead,
        definitely not alive - still clutching his beloved shovel. He soon learned
        that with it he could act as a ferryman for the Isles'' undead denizens, helping
        them climb death''s many-tiered ladder. This proved a curse, as a gravedigger
        must "bury his quota" before he too can ascend, or so the legend goes. No
        one knows what "his quota" is. Yorick dug tirelessly, waiting in vain for
        the day when he would be freed of his burden. As decades turned to centuries,
        the shame of his failures came to a head. He returned to Valoran to find his
        corpse, convinced that salvation might be buried with it. When he arrived,
        no trace remained of either the mausoleum or the memorial. Hope nearly lost,
        he discovered the League of Legends, and there saw an opportunity to immortalize
        the family name he allowed to be forgotten ages ago.', quote: 'Die first,

    lore: {desc: 'There exists an ancient order originating in the Ionian Isles dedicated
        to the preservation of balance. Order, chaos, light, darkness -- all things
        must exist in perfect harmony for such is the way of the universe. This order
        is known as the Kinkou and it employs a triumvirate of shadow warriors to
        uphold its causes in the world. Kennen is one of these shadow warriors, entrusted
        with the sacred duty of Coursing the Sun - tirelessly conveying the justice
        of the Kinkou.


        Kennen was born in Bandle City and it was said that in his first living moments
        he bolted first from the womb and second from the midwife who delivered him.
        His parents had thought that he would outgrow his boundless energy, but as
        he matured his energy found no limits and was matched only by his unnerving
        speed. Despite his astonishing gifts, he remained unnoticed (or at least uncaught,
        as he was quite the prankster) until, on a dare, he ran straight up the great
        outer wall of the Placidium. When word of this feat reached Kinkou ears, Kennen
        was quickly and quietly brought in for an audience. He found that the role
        of the Heart of the Tempest suited him, frenetically delivering both the word
        and the punishments of the Kinkou across the realm. He now works with his
        fellows Akali and Shen to enforce the balance of Valoran. This hallowed pursuit
        has unsurprisingly led the triumvirate to the Fields of Justice.', quote: The

    lore: {desc: 'Throughout Valoran, the resolve of Demacia''s military is alternately
        celebrated or despised, but always respected.  Their "zero tolerance" moral
        code is strictly upheld by civilians and soldiers alike.  In combat, this
        means Demacian troops may not make excuses, flee, or surrender under any circumstance.  These
        principles are espoused to their forces by unrivaled demagogues who lead by
        example.  Garen, the valiant warrior who bears the title "the Might of Demacia",
        is the paradigm to which these leaders are compared.  Thousands of great heroes
        have risen and fallen on the bloody battlefields between Demacia and its preeminent
        rival, Noxus.  It was beneath their mighty banners of war that Garen first
        met steel with Katarina, the Sinister Blade.  The infantrymen who beheld this
        event (and survived) commented that it seemed as though the two were locked
        in a mortal waltz against a symphony of clashing blades.


        Garen, the pride of the Demacian military and leader of the Dauntless Vanguard,
        returned from this battle breathless for the first time in his career, though
        some speculate that this was due to reasons other than exhaustion.  The plausibility
        of these rumors was bolstered when, in every instance thereafter, Garen seized
        the opportunity to encounter the Sinister Blade again.  A paragon of Demacian
        ethic, Garen never entertained such allegations, for he knew others couldn''t
        understand.  Even simply the pursuit of a worthy opponent on the battlefield
        is, to a true warrior, the reason to rise each morning.  The promise of one,
        particularly so beautifully and diametrically opposed, is the validation of
        his existence.', quote: The most effective way to kill an opponent is to slice

    lore: {desc: 'On the upper slopes of Mount Targon, the warriors of Rakkor live
        and breathe only for war.  However, Targon''s peak is reserved for a special
        group of Rakkoran who answer to a "higher" calling.  Members of this group,
        called the Solari, retire their mantles of war, choosing instead to devote
        their lives to reverence of the sun.  According to legend, the Solari were
        formed by a warrior who could call the raw might of the sun down upon his
        enemies in combat.  He claimed Mount Targon''s summit, the point on Valoran
        closest to the sun, for his solar devotion, a tradition which generations
        of Solari have preserved to this day.


        Leona''s parents were traditional Rakkorans, both bred for the heat of battle.  To
        them, Leona was a problem child.  She was capable of fighting as fiercely
        as any other -- including her childhood friend, Pantheon -- but she did not
        share their zeal for killing.  She believed that the true worth of a soldier
        lay in her ability to defend and protect.  When it came time for her Rite
        of Kor, a ceremony in which two Rakkoran teens battle to the death for the
        right to bear a relic-weapon, Leona refused to fight.  For this, the Rakkoran
        leaders ordered her execution, but when they tried to strike the fatal blow,
        sunlight burst forth, bathing Mount Targon in light.  As it faded, Leona stood
        unharmed and her executioners lay unconscious around her.  The Solari immediately
        claimed Leona, demanding that her sentence be repealed.  She donned the golden
        armor of the Solari and they bestowed upon her the sword and shield passed
        down from the ancient sun-warriors of legend.  The Solari helped Leona focus
        her abilities, and when she was ready she left to join the League of Legends.',

        it was during the night''s chilling embrace that Malzahar relinquished his
        sanity.  Malzahar was born a seer, blessed with the gift of prophecy.  His
        talent, though unrefined, promised to be one of Runeterra''s greatest boons,
        but destiny plotted him another course; his sensitivity to the roiling tides
        of fate allowed other, unwelcome things to tug at his subconscious mind.  In
        his dreams, where the veil of separation is thinnest, a sinister thing beckoned.  For
        some time, Malzahar was able to resist its prodding solicitation, but with
        each passing night the voice grew louder, or perhaps deeper, until he could
        withstand the call no more.


        He ventured into the desert without supplies, drawn by the lure of a specious
        charm.  His destination: a lost civilization to the east, known to ancient
        texts as Icathia.  Few believed such a place ever existed, and those who did
        were certain that the sands had long since devoured whatever remained.  When
        Malzahar''s cracked feet finally failed him, he found himself kneeling at
        the base of a bizarre crumbling obelisk.  Beyond it lay the alien geometry
        of a ruined city and the giant decaying idols of dark and horrific gods.  His
        eyes, seeing what others cannot, and what none should, were filled with the
        essence of the Void.  His once shifting visions of the future were replaced
        with the immutable promise of Valoran beset by creatures of the Void.  Standing
        alone, but not alone, amidst the echoing dunes, he noticed the familiar voice
        escape his own lips in a parched rasp, bearing three words whose weight trembled
        his knees.  League of Legends.  Now infused with the power of the void itself,
        Malzahar set off to the north to seek his fate.', quote: 'The land may melt,

        passages and the reassuring steel of a blade. He remembers no family, warmth,
        or kindness. Instead, the clink of stolen gold and the security of a wall
        at his back are all the kinship he has ever craved. Kept alive only by his
        quick wits and deft thievery, Talon scraped out a living in the seedy underbelly
        of Noxus. His mastery of the blade quickly marked him as a threat, and Noxian
        guilds sent assassins to him with a demand: join their ranks or be killed.
        He left the bodies of his pursuers dumped in Noxus'' moat as his response.


        The assassination attempts grew increasingly dangerous until one assailant
        met Talon blade-for-blade in a match of strength. To his surprise, Talon was
        disarmed and facing down his executioner''s sword when the assassin revealed
        himself to be General Du Couteau. The General offered Talon the choice between
        death at his hand, or life as an agent of the Noxian High Command. Talon chose
        life, on the condition that his service was to Du Couteau alone, for the only
        type of orders he could respect were from one he could not defeat. Talon remained
        in the shadows, carrying out secret missions on Du Couteau''s orders that
        took him from the frigid lands of Freljord to the inner sanctums of Bandle
        City. When the general vanished, Talon considered reclaiming his freedom,
        but he had gained immense respect for Du Couteau after years in his service.
        He became obsessed with tracking down the general''s whereabouts. Talon''s
        suspicions led him to the doors of the Institute of War, where he joined the
        League of Legends in order to find those responsible for Du Couteau''s disappearance.',

        strength lay in her conviction. She entered battles without any trace of doubt
        in her mind: no ethical pause, no fear of death. Riven became a leader amongst
        her peers, poster child of the Noxian spirit. So exceptional was her passion
        that the High Command recognized her with a black stone rune sword forged
        and enchanted with Noxian sorcery.  The weapon was heavier than a kite shield
        and nearly as broad - perfectly suited to her tastes. Soon after, she was
        deployed to Ionia as part of the Noxian invasion.


        What began as war quickly became extermination. Noxian soldiers followed the
        terrifying Zaunite war machines across fields of death. It wasn''t the glorious
        combat for which Riven trained.  She carried out the orders of her superiors,
        terminating the remnants of a beaten and fractured enemy with extreme prejudice.
        As the invasion continued, it became clear that the Ionian society would not
        be reformed, merely eliminated. During one bitter engagement, Riven''s unit
        became surrounded by Ionian forces. They called for support as the enemy closed
        in around them. What they received instead was a barrage of biochemical terror
        launched by Singed. Riven watched as around her Ionian and Noxian alike fell
        victim to an unspeakably gruesome fate. She managed to escape the bombardment,
        though she could not erase the memory. Counted dead by Noxus, she saw an opportunity
        to start anew. She shattered her sword, severing ties with the past, and wandered
        in self-imposed exile - on a quest to seek atonement and a way to save the
        pure Noxian vision in which she believed.', quote: There is a place between

    lore: {desc: 'When the prophet Malzahar was reborn in Icathia, he was led there
        by an ominous voice which thereafter anchored itself to his psyche. From within,
        this voice bestowed upon him terrible purpose, and though Malzahar was no
        longer tormented by its call, the voice did not cease its unrelenting summons.
        This baleful beacon''s gentle flicker -- now fastened to Runeterra -- drew
        forth a putrid beast that ambled across a threshold it did not understand,
        widening a fissure between the spaces which were never meant to meet. There
        amongst the haunting ruins of Icathia, Kog''Maw manifested in Valoran with
        unsettling curiosity. The spark which led him to Runeterra teased him still,
        urging him gently towards Malzahar. It also encouraged him to familiarize
        himself with his new environment, to the stark horror of everything he encountered
        on his journey.


        The enchanting colors and aromas of Runeterra intoxicated Kog''Maw, and he
        explored the fruits of the strange world the only way he knew how: by devouring
        them. At first he sampled only the wild flora and fauna he happened across.
        As he traversed the parched Tempest Flats, however, he came upon a tribe of
        nomads. Seemingly unhampered by conventional rules of physics, Kog''Maw consumed
        every nomad and any obstacles they put in his way, amounting to many times
        his own mass and volume. The most composed of his victims may have had time
        to wonder if this was due to the caustic enzymes which stung the ground as
        they dripped from his gaping mouth, although such musings were abruptly concluded.
        When his wake of catastrophe reached the Institute of War, an enthusiastic
        Malzahar greeted him with an enticing prospect: taste the best Runeterra could
        offer...on the Fields of Justice.', quote: 'If that''s just hungry, I don''t

        Born to a clan whose members have decorated the ranks of the Kinkou for generations,
        Shen was trained his entire life to become the Eye of Twilight, and thereupon
        to dispassionately determine what must be done in the interests of equilibrium.  As
        his final trial to ascend to this position, he was made to attend the Takanu,
        a ceremony in which his father was tortured before his eyes to test his resolve.  Any
        reaction whatsoever would have resulted in his immediate disqualification,
        but he never averted his gaze and never blinked, not once.  As the Eye of
        Twilight, Shen must make decisions that would buckle the wills of ordinary
        men, removing all emotion from the equation.  He now works with his fellows
        Akali and Kennen to enforce the balance of Valoran.  This hallowed pursuit
        has unsurprisingly led the triumvirate to the Fields of Justice.

    lore: {desc: 'In the ancient civilization of Shurima, the mage called Xerath practiced
        magic with undying passion. He believed that with enough magical power, he
        could gaze into the heart of Runeterra to know the secrets of history and
        the universe beyond. Such magic was beyond the limitations of a mortal body,
        but Xerath obsessively pursued a path to infinite power nonetheless. With
        every breakthrough he grew more and more powerful, yet not without consequence.
        Xerath''s increasing arcane abilities wrought havoc on his physical form.
        Desperate, he undertook a dangerous ritual to transcend his dying body. The
        outcome would be immortality or self-destruction. Violent magic unleashed
        during the ritual caused devastation throughout Shurima, but when the dust
        settled, Xerath emerged as an ascended being of pure arcane energy.


        Free of flesh and bone, Xerath held nearly infinite power at his command.
        However, in the wake of his chaotic ritual, the mages of Shurima feared his
        careless disregard for life would bring ruin to the kingdom. After a terrible
        struggle they subdued Xerath, but they could not destroy his ascended form.
        Instead they trapped him within an enchanted sarcophagus and sealed him in
        an underground tomb. Eons passed, civilizations rose and fell, and Xerath''s
        imprisonment was lost to memory. For centuries, Xerath''s vast power tore
        away at the sarcophagus and weakened its spell. Finally, he willed forth a
        burst of magic that shattered his prison, but its core remained, containing
        Xerath and his power within its broken pieces. Seeking to rid himself of this
        burden, he was drawn to the magic of Valoran''s nexuses and found he could
        absorb their power. Yet the nexuses had gatekeepers: petty mages known as
        summoners. Xerath knew his key to true freedom from his prison lay in gaining
        their trust, and he offered his power to the League of Legends.', quote: I

        searched all her life for belonging. Persecution forged her into a brutal
        warrior, and those who dare stand against Shyvana face the fiery beast lurking
        just beneath her skin.


        Dragonkind considered Shyvana''s impure blood an abomination, and she spent
        her youth pursued relentlessly by one cruel drake. Constantly on the run,
        she and her father, an outcast dragon, never knew a lasting home. A brutal
        reflection of countless battles, Shyvana grew hateful and savage. After years
        of strife, her father finally fell to the other dragon, but not before gravely
        wounding his foe. Furious with grief, Shyvana pursued her father''s murderer
        as he fled north to recover. There she encountered a group of humans on the
        trail of the same drake. Though the men looked upon her in fear, their leader
        approached Shyvana peacefully. He introduced himself as Jarvan IV, the Prince
        of Demacia, and offered to aid Shyvana in her quest for vengeance. Together
        they hunted down and confronted the vicious dragon that had slain her father.
        Shyvana did not expect the men to survive, but in the clash of fire and steel,
        Jarvan and his men fought with strength she had never believed humans to possess.
        The ironclad warriors drove their foe into submission, and Shyvana struck
        the final blow, tearing the beast''s heart from its body. Inspired by her
        ferocity, Jarvan offered her a place in the ranks of his elite guard. Shyvana
        could still see fear in the eyes of his men, but she longed for a true home.
        Trusting Jarvan''s word, she accepted his offer and now serves as a Demacian
        warrior. Though her human allies admire her power, they keep their distance.
        Shyvana strives to repay the prince''s kindness with the power of the dragon
        within, but she cannot help but wonder if the humans are right to fear her.',

    lore: {desc: 'Unlike other foxes that roamed the woods of southern Ionia, Ahri
        had always felt a strange connection to the magical world around her; a connection
        that was somehow incomplete. Deep inside, she felt the skin she had been born
        into was an ill fit for her and dreamt of one day becoming human. Her goal
        seemed forever out of reach, until she happened upon the wake of a human battle.
        It was a grisly scene, the land obscured by the forms of wounded and dying
        soldiers. She felt drawn to one: a robed man encircled by a waning field of
        magic whose life was quickly slipping away. She approached him and something
        deep inside of her triggered, reaching out to the man in a way she couldn''t
        understand. His life essence poured into her, carried on invisible strands
        of magic. The sensation was intoxicating and overwhelming. As her reverie
        faded, she was delighted to discover that she had changed. Her sleek white
        fur had receded and her body was long and lithe - the shape of the humans
        who lay scattered about her.


        However, though she appeared human, she knew that in truth the transformation
        was incomplete. A cunning creature, she adapted herself to the customs of
        human society and used her profound gift of beauty to attract unsuspecting
        men. She could consume their life essences when they were under the spell
        of her seductive charms. Feeding on their desires brought her closer to her
        dream, but as she took more lives, a strange sense of regret began to well
        within her. She had reservations about actions which never troubled her as
        a fox. She realized that she could not overcome the pangs of her evolving
        morality. In search of a solution, Ahri found the Institute of War, home of
        the most gifted mages on Runeterra. They offered her a chance to attain her
        humanity without further harm through service in the League of Legends.',

    lore: {desc: 'Centuries ago, an ancient water-dwelling race built a hidden city
        beneath a mountain in the sea. Though these creatures had their enemies, the
        city was an impenetrable fortress, and, in the safety it provided, they grew
        complacent. Fizz, however, harbored a curious spirit that could not be satisfied
        living so cushioned a life. Unable to resist the allure of danger, Fizz had
        a habit of sneaking out of the city to look for trouble. In his many adventures
        he grew to be a powerful fighter with a keen resourcefulness that let him
        skirt danger with clever ease. One day, Fizz returned to find the city abandoned:
        his people had vanished, leaving Fizz without a clue to explain their disappearance.
        With nothing left in the city to keep him, Fizz salvaged an enchanted trident
        from the ruins and set out alone.


        For years, Fizz wandered the ocean, using the skills he''d learned during
        his adventures as a young boy to survive. Finally, Fizz discovered the port
        of Bilgewater. He was fascinated with the existence of life above the water
        and could not resist exploring the island. In his endless curiosity, Fizz
        inadverently meddled in the affairs of the humans who lived there and his
        presence did not go unnoticed. His mischief angered many residents who eventually
        sought to capture or kill him. Fizz found himself cornered, and he prepared
        to return to the sea despite the fondness he''d come to hold for Bilgewater.
        As he stood at the docks, a massive dragon-shark attacked the port. Fizz defeated
        the beast, using his resourcefulness and knowledge of the creatures'' weaknesses
        to his advantage. Having earned the gratitude and respect of the humans, Fizz
        decided to stay in Bilgewater. He joined the League of Legends to further
        serve his new home.', quote: Fizz makes even the saltiest sailors of Bilgewater

        lands in Valoran, the Ursine have survived upon the region''s barren, stormy
        tundra for centuries. As a fierce and respected warrior of the Ursine, Volibear
        devoted his life to the protection of his people and loyalty to his elder
        brother, the tribe''s chief. When his brother was killed during a hunt on
        the tundra, the tribe looked to Volibear as his successor. It was an honor
        and a burden that Volibear had never expected, but he shouldered the charge
        with pride. However, by Ursine tradition, the tribe could not recognize Volibear
        as chief until he returned from a journey to the peak of their sacred mountain,
        a place forever shrouded in a thundering maelstrom. There, Ursine chieftains
        must speak to the storm itself, gaining clarity and wisdom to empower them
        as mighty leaders.


        Donning the chieftain''s traditional armor and enchanted gauntlets, Volibear
        began the long and perilous climb up the slopes of the mountain. When he reached
        the peak and gazed into the raging storm above, he saw a horrific vision of
        a Freljord utterly consumed by war. Amidst the carnage, the Ursine fell dead
        upon a bloody battlefield. Believing the vision to be an omen of things to
        come if he did not act against them, Volibear traveled to the capitol of Freljord.
        The Ursine had not ventured across the southern mountains in centuries and
        his appearance was met with unease. However, Queen Ashe recognized Volibear
        as a wise and powerful ally. In what Volibear considered the first step against
        a war-torn future, they forged an alliance. As part of their agreement, he

        - a warning to would-be aggressors. He thought undisputed reign of a region
        would fulfill him, but instead, he grew restless. No beasts in his domain
        proved challenging prey, and without formidable adversaries to push his limits,
        Rengar''s spirit waned. He feared that no worthwhile game remained, that he
        would never again feel the thrill of the hunt. Just when things seemed their
        bleakest, he encountered the monster. It was a disturbing, alien thing, distinctly
        out of place in his world. It bore huge scything claws and devoured any animal
        that strayed across its path. Overzealous at the prospect of a challenge,
        Rengar ambushed the monster in haste. It far outclassed anything he''d hunted
        before. Their fight was savage, and each suffered crippling wounds. Rengar
        lost an eye, but the most grievous blow was to his pride. He had never before
        failed to make the kill. Worse yet, the severity of his injuries forced him
        to retreat. Over the following days, he hovered on the threshold between life
        and death. He was wracked with pain, but beneath it, he felt a glimmer of
        joy. The hunt was on. If such powerful beings existed in the world, he would
        find them, and stack their heads high. The monster, however, was a kill he
        wanted to savor. On his den''s largest wall, he reserves a space for the beast''s
        head, a trophy he swears will one day be the centerpiece of his collection.',

    lore: {desc: 'For his incomparable skill with the bow and his unquestioned sense
        of honor, Varus was chosen to be the warden of a sacred Ionian temple. The
        temple was built to contain an ancient pit of corruption so vile that Ionian
        Elders feared it could envelop the island in darkness. Varus prided himself
        on his position, as only the most exceptional Ionian warriors were selected
        for the role. He lived with his family in a nearby village and led a quiet
        life of disciplined routine until the day the forces of Noxus invaded Ionia.
        Their shock troops left nothing but death and desolation in their wake, and
        the temple lay in their path. Varus was forced to make a decision. He was
        bound by honor to stay and defend the temple, but without him the village''s
        few inhabitants could offer little resistance against the oncoming war machine.
        Gravely, he chose to fulfill his duty as a warden. The corruption could not
        be allowed to escape.


        His arrows sundered the troops who tried to wrest the temple from him that
        day. However, when he returned to the village, he found that it had been reduced
        to a smoldering graveyard. Remorse at the sight of his slain family gave way
        to overwhelming regret and then to seething hatred. He swore to slaughter
        every Noxian invader, but first he needed to become stronger. He turned to
        that which he had sacrificed everything to protect. The pit of corruption
        would consume him wholly, as a flame devours a wick, but its abominable power
        would burn within him until he was lost. This was a path from which there
        could be no return. With grim resolve, he condemned himself to the black flames,
        feeling malevolent energy bond to his skin...and with it, the promise of ruin.
        He left, seeking the blood of all Noxians involved with the invasion, a grisly
        task that eventually led him to the invasion''s most infamous perpetrators
        in the League of Legends.', quote: 'The life of an arrow is fleeting, built

    lore: {desc: 'Once, Nautilus was a sailor commissioned by the Institute of War
        to explore the uncharted reaches of the Guardian''s Sea. This expedition took
        him deep into unknown waters where he and his crew found a vast section of
        black oozing liquid that none of the crew could identify. Though their job
        was to investigate anything new that they found, no man aboard was willing
        to brave the murk except Nautilus. Only moments after he donned the hulking
        diver''s suit and climbed over the ship''s rail, something lurking in the
        muck grabbed hold of him. He clung to the side of the ship, but the thing
        below pulled him fiercely, rocking the entire ship. The other sailors grew
        afraid and made a terrible decision. As he stared and pled for help, they
        wrenched his grip free of the rail. He tumbled into the ink, grabbing the
        anchor in futile desperation. Dark tendrils enveloped him and he could do
        nothing but watch as the dimming outline of his ship faded away. Then everything
        went black.


        When Nautilus awoke, he was something... different. The great iron suit had
        become a seamless shell around him, concealing whatever awful truth lay inside.
        All the details of his memory seemed fuzzy and indistinct but one fact remained
        clear: he was left here, alone in the sunless depths, to die. In his hands
        he still clutched the anchor that belonged to the men who had condemned him.
        Having no other purpose, he took this clue and trudged - too heavy to swim
        or run - in search of answers. He wandered without direction or sense of passing
        time in what felt like an eternal dream. By the time he stumbled upon the
        shores of Bilgewater, he could find no traces of the man he was. No house,
        no family, no life to which he could return. Terrified sailors who''d heard
        his tale directed Nautilus back to the Institute, but the summoners refused
        to relinquish the names of the others they commissioned. By then Nautilus
        had learned about the League of Legends and there he saw an opportunity to
        discover and punish those responsible for the time and life he lost.', quote: 'When

    lore: {desc: 'Early in life, Viktor discovered his passion for science and invention,
        particularly in the field of mechanical automation.  He attended Zaun''s prestigious
        College of Techmaturgy and led the team that constructed Blitzcrank - a scientific
        breakthrough that he expected to vault him to the top of his profession.  Unfortunately
        his triumph was usurped by Professor Stanwick, who stole credit for developing
        Blitzcrank''s sentience and later used Viktor''s research to revive Urgot.  Viktor''s
        appeals for justice fell on deaf ears, and he sank into a deep depression.  He
        withdrew from the College and barricaded himself in his private laboratory,
        cutting all human ties.  There, in secret, he conceived a project for which
        nobody else could claim credit.  Desiring both to revolutionize his field
        and to eliminate the jealous human emotions which festered inside him, he
        engineered parts to replace and improve his own body.


        When Viktor re-emerged, almost no trace of the original man remained.  Not
        only had he supplanted the majority of his anatomy, but his personality had
        changed.  His previous hope to better society was replaced by an obsession
        with what he called "the glorious evolution."  He saw himself as the patron
        and pioneer of Valoran''s future - a future in which man would renounce his
        flesh in favor of superior hextech augmentations.  Though Viktor''s initial
        appeals were met with heavy skepticism, scientists were confounded by the
        sophistication of his machinery.  By integrating his mind with techmaturgical
        devices, he had been able to drastically accelerate the progress of his research.  His
        transformation had stripped him of what he perceived as his emotional weaknesses,
        but there was some lingering residue of resentment against the Professor.  Viktor
        joined the League of Legends to pit his inventions against the greatest opponents
        Valoran could offer, and to correct any weaknesses or inefficiencies that
        remained.', quote: 'In one''s hand, techmaturgy is a tool.  As one''s hand,
        it is liberation.', quote_author: Viktor}

    lore: {desc: 'When Sejuani was born, the mystics of her tribe foretold that she
        would be the one to unite and lead the divided territories of Freljord.  Her
        people had suffered for centuries, as a losing war on the frozen tundra pushed
        them farther and farther from Freljord''s limited food supplies.  Sejuani
        grew up surrounded by this misery, and it fueled her desire to fulfill her
        destiny.  She pushed herself to extremes, walking out into blizzards without
        food or furs and training while frigid winds raked her flesh.  She sparred
        with the strongest warriors of her tribe, one after another, until her legs
        would give out beneath her.  She sustained injuries that would have killed
        any other member of the tribe, but she would only rise again, driven by sheer
        force of will and what her tribe took to calling her "heart of the blizzard."


        On her twentieth birthday, Sejuani declared that she would lead her people
        out of their remote isolation to conquer the lands of their enemies.  She
        had completed her training and she was ready to face the leaders of the opposing
        tribes.  Her feats had already become legend and soldiers in her company were
        inspired to new heights of strength and resolve.  However, before she struck
        out on her campaign, Ashe began campaigning for peace in Freljord, joining
        the League of Legends to demonstrate how the people could be spared violence.  To
        Sejuani, this was a violation of tradition - a coward''s ruse to hoard Freljord''s
        precious few resources.  She saw the confidence of her people wane as it seemed
        they would never be delivered from their plight.  She decided that to truly
        prove herself as the rightful ruler of Freljord, she must defeat Ashe completely

        surpassed that of her siblings. Fiora''s peers perceived her confidence as
        arrogance, but she dismissed them, striving even harder to become a worthy
        successor to her father. Her devotion turned out to be misplaced. On the eve
        of an arranged duel, authorities caught Fiora''s father slipping a paralysis
        poison into his opponent''s drink. His treachery destroyed the family''s reputation,
        and Fiora''s own honor fell under question. Outraged and desperate to clear
        her name, she challenged her father to a duel. Though he fought with power
        and style, Fiora realized the man had long forgotten the discipline that defined
        a true duelist. She disarmed him, and with her blade to his chest, she demanded
        control of House Laurent. Her father surrendered, but even in victory, Fiora
        knew the shadow of doubt still tainted her reputation. Intent to seize her
        destiny, Fiora vows to surpass her father''s false legacy and prove that she
        is not only the greatest duelist in Demacia - but all of Valoran.', quote: 'I

    lore: {desc: 'Ziggs was born with a talent for tinkering, but his chaotic, hyperactive
        nature was unusual among yordle scientists. Aspiring to be a revered inventor
        like Heimerdinger, he rattled through ambitious projects with manic zeal,
        emboldened by both his explosive failures and his unprecedented discoveries.
        Word of Ziggs'' volatile experimentation reached the famed Yordle Academy
        in Piltover and its esteemed professors invited him to demonstrate his craft.
        His characteristic disregard for safety brought the presentation to an early
        conclusion, however, when the hextech engine Ziggs was demonstrating overheated
        and exploded, blowing a huge hole in the wall of the Academy. The professors
        dusted themselves off and sternly motioned for him to leave. Devastated, Ziggs
        prepared to return to Bandle City in shame. However, before he could leave,
        a group of Zaunite agents infiltrated the Academy and kidnapped the professors.
        The Piltover military tracked the captives to a Zaunite prison, but their
        weapons were incapable of destroying the fortified walls. Determined to outdo
        them, Ziggs began experimenting on a new kind of armament, and quickly realized
        that he could harness his accidental gift for demolition to save the captured
        yordles.


        Before long, Ziggs had created a line of powerful bombs he lovingly dubbed
        "hexplosives." With his new creations ready for their first trial, Ziggs traveled
        to Zaun and sneaked into the prison compound. He launched a gigantic bomb
        at the prison and watched with glee as the explosion tore through the reinforced
        wall. Once the smoke had cleared, Ziggs scuttled into the facility, sending
        guards running with a hail of bombs. He rushed to the cell, blew the door
        off its hinges, and led the captive yordles to freedom. Upon returning to
        the Academy, the humbled professors recognized Ziggs with an honorary title
        - Dean of Demolitions - and proposed that he demonstrate this new form of
        yordle ingenuity in the League of Legends. Vindicated at last, Ziggs accepted
        the proposal, eager to bring his ever-expanding range of hexplosives to the
        greatest testing grounds in the world: the Fields of Justice.', quote: 'Ziggs?

    lore: {desc: 'Perhaps more than any other champion in the League, Lulu marches
        to the beat of her own drum. During her youth in Bandle City, she spent most
        of her time wandering alone in the forest or lost in a daydream. It wasn''t
        that she was antisocial; the day-to-day bustle of Bandle City just couldn''t
        compete with the vibrant world of her imagination. She saw wonder in places
        most people overlooked. This was how she found Pix, a fae spirit, pretending
        to be stuck in a birdhouse. Lulu''s imagination distinguished her to Pix and
        he seized the opportunity to lure her into his world. He brought her to the
        Glade, the enchanted home of the fae, which lay nestled in a clearing in the
        woods. There the rigid properties of the outside world - things like size
        and color - changed as frequently and whimsically as the direction of the
        wind. Lulu felt at home in the Glade and she lingered there with Pix, fascinated
        by this secret place.


        She quickly lost track of time. Her life in the Glade was comfortable and
        natural. She and Pix played fae games together, the sorts of games that she
        had been told were "make believe"... and she got exceedingly good at them.
        It caught her by surprise when she suddenly remembered that she had left a
        life behind in Bandle City. The Glade had a way of making everything outside
        seem distant and surreal. Lulu decided to revisit her former home, to share
        some of the lovely things she''d learned, but when she and Pix returned the
        world had changed. Time, she discovered, was another property that behaved
        differently in the Glade, and centuries had passed while she was away. Lulu
        sought to reconnect to the residents of the outside world but her attempts
        had unfortunate results. She led all the children off to play hide and seek,
        temporarily changing them into flowers and animals to spice up the game, but
        their parents didn''t appreciate her efforts. When the yordles insisted that
        she leave their land, she turned to a vibrant magical place where those with
        unusual gifts were not just accepted but adored: the League of Legends.',

    lore: {desc: 'Unlike his brother Darius, victory in battle was never enough for
        Draven. He craved recognition, acclaim, and glory. He first sought greatness
        in the Noxian military, but his flair for the dramatic went severely underappreciated.  Thirsting
        for a method to share "Draven" with the world, he turned his attention to
        the prison system. There he carved out the celebrity he desired by turning
        the tedious affair of executions into a premiere spectacle.


        At Draven''s first execution, he shocked onlookers when he ordered the doomed
        prisoner to run for dear life. Just before the man managed to flee from sight,
        Draven brought him down with a flawless throw of his axe.  Soon, all Draven''s
        executions became a gauntlet through which Noxian prisoners raced for a final
        chance at life. He used this trial as his own personal stage, and turned executions
        into a leading form of entertainment. He rallied onlookers into a frenzy,
        while desperate prisoners scrambled to evade him. They never succeeded. Rejecting
        the solemn, black uniforms of Noxian executioners Draven donned bright outfits
        and developed flashy signature moves to distinguish himself. Crowds flocked
        to see Draven in action, and tales of his performances spread quickly. As
        his popularity grew, so did his already-inflated ego. He belonged at the center
        of attention. Before long, the scope of his ambitions outgrew the population
        of Noxus. He decided that the glorious exploits of Draven should be put on
        display for the entire world.', quote: ' ''The best'' is wherever I decide

    lore: {desc: 'Since his first sighting on the northwestern shores of Valoran,
        the towering, armored specter known as Hecarim struck a chilling fear into
        the hearts of all who laid eyes upon him. No one had ever seen anything like
        his titanic, ethereal form before, and the mystery of his sudden arrival was
        deeply unnerving. When Hecarim began to march eastwards, leaving a trail of
        desolate, lifeless ground behind him, the villagers of the plains fled their
        homes for the safety of nearby Demacia. In the city''s now-overcrowded taverns,
        rumors about this inhuman phantom spread in hushed whispers. Some claimed
        that he was the vengeful shade of an ancient warrior, intent on destroying
        all living beings; one man insisted that they had seen him leading an entire
        legion of spectral cavalrymen; others still believed him to be the creation
        of some hateful necromancer. One Demacian commander, seeking to dispel the
        terror that had gripped the city, assembled a few of his finest soldiers and
        rode out to turn back or destroy Hecarim.


        The commander led his soldiers to stand in Hecarim''s path and braced for
        his assault. As the apparition bore down on them, an overwhelming sensation
        of dread gripped the warriors. The men, frozen in fear, could only scream
        as the ghostly titan ran them down, tearing them apart and trampling them
        beneath his iron hooves. Hecarim turned to the crippled, cowering commander
        and uttered a chilling statement: "This is merely the beginning. No mortal
        army can withstand the might of the Shadow Isles." With that, Hecarim departed,
        resuming his grim march. Driven to insanity by his nightmarish experience,
        the commander stumbled back to Demacia, where his dire warnings were dismissed
        as the ravings of a madman. While Hecarim''s origin and intent were still
        a mystery, his destination became clear when he reached the Institute of War
        and, in a voice both ominous and commanding, demanded entry into the League
        of Legends.', quote: You don't understand...the shadows will consume us all...,

        and consume Rengar, the one beast he considers his equal.

        find, risking his life to satisfy his need. With each kill he feasted and
        changed, becoming a stronger, faster predator. Kha''Zix soon chased his prey
        with unrestrained aggression, believing he was unstoppable. One day, while
        savoring a fresh kill, the predator became the prey. From cover a creature
        pounced in a blur of fangs and steel, tackling him to the ground. It roared
        in his face slashing and clawing, and Kha''Zix felt his blood spill for the
        first time. Screeching in fury, he sliced at the brute''s eye driving it back.

        separated. As his wounds closed, Kha''Zix burned with anticipation at the

        search for powerful prey with renewed vigor. Someday, Kha''Zix will feast

    lore: {desc: 'There is no greater symbol of Noxian might than Darius, the nation''s
        most feared and battle-hardened warrior. Orphaned at a young age, Darius had
        to fight to keep himself and his younger brother alive. By the time he joined
        the military, he had already developed the strength and discipline of a veteran
        soldier. The first true test of Darius''s resolve occurred in a crucial battle
        against Demacia, where the Noxian forces were exhausted and outnumbered. Darius''s
        captain called for his troops to retreat, but Darius refused to accept such
        an act of cowardice. Breaking formation, Darius strode towards the captain
        and decapitated him with one sweep of his gigantic axe. Both terrified and
        inspired, the soldiers followed Darius into battle and fought with incredible
        strength and fervor. After a long and grueling battle, they ultimately emerged
        victorious.


        Seizing momentum from this victory, Darius led his now fiercely loyal troops
        in a devastating campaign against Demacia. After proving his power on the
        battlefield, Darius turned his gaze homeward. He saw a Noxus riddled with
        weakness, where greedy, complacent nobles drained the nation''s strength.
        Seeking to restore his country to greatness, Darius took it upon himself to
        reshape the Noxian leadership. He identified weak figureheads and violently
        removed them from their positions of power. Many in Noxus saw Darius''s cull
        as an attempt to seize power, but he had a different plan for the throne.
        He had been watching the rise of Jericho Swain with keen interest. In Swain,
        Darius saw a leader with the mind and determination to bring Noxus to glory.
        Now allied with the Master Tactician, Darius works to unite the nation behind
        his vision of true Noxian strength.', quote: A united Noxus could control

        him to study a rare arcane crystal, Jayce discovered it could be used as a
        vast energy source. Eager to make a name for himself, he began developing
        a device to harness its power. Word of the crystal''s potential reached beyond
        the borders of Piltover. Viktor, the machine-augmented scientist from Zaun,
        brought Jayce an offer - together, they could use the crystal to advance his
        "glorious evolution," a vision of humanity fused with technology. Jayce refused,
        but the Zaunite had no intention of leaving empty handed. He effortlessly
        blasted Jayce aside and seized the crystal, incinerating the lab''s meager
        security force as he left for Zaun. Jayce implored the Piltover government
        to respond, but the officials refused to support an act of aggression. He
        decided to act alone, realizing that if no one struck back, Piltover would
        never be safe.


        Jayce returned to the lab to prepare for his attack. After intense research,
        development, and hands-on testing, he emerged with his crowning achievement
        - the Mercury Hammer. Weapon in hand, Jayce marched to Zaun and began his
        one-man assault. Viktor''s acolytes rushed to stop him, but Jayce smashed
        them aside, fighting his way into the heart of the lab. Inside, Jayce saw
        the horrifying brilliance of Viktor''s creations, all powered by the energy
        of the arcane crystal. He realized that his only option was to destroy the
        power source, but Viktor stood in his way. Though their clash left both scientists
        heavily wounded, Jayce managed a desperate strike at the crystal. He shattered
        it and escaped as Viktor''s machines erupted in flames. When he returned home,
        exhausted but victorious, the citizens of Piltover hailed Jayce as a hero.
        He reveled in the adoration, but knew that his actions had drawn the attention

    lore: {desc: 'An unyielding avatar of the moon''s power, Diana wages a dark crusade
        against the sun-worshipping Solari. Though she once sought the acceptance
        of her people, years of futile struggle shaped her into a bitter, resentful
        warrior. She now presents her foes with a terrible ultimatum: revere the moon''s
        light, or die by her crescent blade.


        Though she was born to the Solari, Diana''s inquisitive nature set her apart
        from her brethren. She had always found solace and guidance in the night sky,
        and questioned the dominance of the sun in her society. The Solari elders
        responded to her challenges with only derision and punishment. Diana remained
        convinced, however, that if she could find evidence of the moon''s power,
        the elders would listen to reason. For years, she studied Solari archives
        in solitude until she discovered an encoded message hidden in an old tome.
        This clue led her to a secluded valley on Mount Targon where she unearthed
        the hidden entrance to an ancient, sealed temple. Inside, among aging relics
        and faded murals, she found an ornate suit of armor and a beautiful crescent
        blade, both inscribed with sigils of the moon. Diana donned the armaments
        and returned to the Solari elders that night. She declared that the artifacts
        proved others had once worshipped the moon as she did. Her discovery of evidence
        challenging Solari dominion shocked the elders. To Diana''s horror, they pronounced
        her a heretic and condemned her to death. As the elders prepared her for execution,
        Diana''s anger and sorrow overwhelmed her desire for acceptance. She lifted
        her gaze to the sky, calling upon the moon for strength. Lunar power surged
        within her and she shattered her bindings. Raising her relic blade, she turned
        and slaughtered the elders. With the temple in ruins behind her, Diana resolved
        to destroy all those who would deny the power of the moon.', quote: The sun

        was a school - a place where she could develop her talents under his guidance.
        Though she learned much during her time there, Syndra no longer felt her power
        growing as it had in her youth. Her frustration grew, and she finally confronted

    lore: {desc: 'Longing to take control of her fate, the ancient, dying plant Zyra
        transferred her consciousness into a human body for a second chance at life.
        Centuries ago, she and her kind dominated the Kumungu Jungle, using thorns
        and vines to consume any animal that set foot in their territory. As the years
        passed, the animal population steadily died off. Food became increasingly
        scarce, and Zyra could only stand by helplessly as the last of her kin withered
        away. She thought she would perish alone, until the appearance of an unwary
        sorceress presented her with an opportunity for salvation.


        It was the first time in years Zyra had sensed a creature wander so close.
        Hunger drew her to the sorceress, but some other, deeper instinct compelled
        her. She enveloped the woman in thorns with ease, but as she savored this
        final meal, foreign memories invaded her thoughts. She saw great jungles of
        metal and stone where humans and animals thrived. Potent magic surged through
        her vines, and she devised an elegant but risky plan to survive. Using the
        woman''s memories, Zyra poured her newfound magic into the creation of a human-shaped
        vessel. She didn''t know what sort of world awaited her, but she had nothing
        left to lose. When Zyra opened her eyes, she was overwhelmed by the raw power
        ready at her fingertips. It wasn''t until she noticed the shriveled remains
        of the plant she once was that she realized how vulnerable she had become.
        If this body died, there would be no network of vines to retreat through,
        no roots to regrow her...but she felt truly alive. She beheld the world for
        the first time as animals did, and a dark smile crept across her lips. She
        was reborn, and there was so much now within her grasp.', quote: 'Closer to

    internal_name: Zac
    lore: {desc: 'Zac is the product of a Zaun experiment to manufacture a hexchem-engineered
        supersoldier - the Zaun Amorphous Combatant. Combining brute strength with
        limitless flexibility, he is a versatile juggernaut: a creative fighter who
        bounces over obstacles and pounds his foes into submission. Though he was
        created inside a weapons laboratory, Zac was rescued and adopted by two loving
        parents who raised him to be a kind and friendly child. As the years passed,
        he grew up to be a fierce hero, sworn to protect the ordinary, everyday people
        of Zaun.


        Long ago, two Zaun scientists developed an organic substance that could withstand
        extreme conditions, spontaneously alter its biological structure, and generate
        tremendous amounts of kinetic force.  As the scientists, husband and wife,
        watched the prototype grow from a spoon-sized droplet to a small blob, they
        noticed that their creation would respond to their presence. It sprung forward
        when they called and bounced when they sang. The couple began to see more
        than an experiment; they saw a small child, filled with affection and joy.


        After testing the prototype one evening, the scientists placed the blob back
        in its cage. It slouched and shuddered in the corner, inconsolably sad.  At
        that moment, the couple realized that their beloved creation wished for a
        free life outside the lab. They were struck by their conscience and could
        not allow the prototype to be used as a weapon.  The husband and wife fled
        with the young blob, replacing its weapon designation - Zaun Amorphous Combatant
        - with a proper name: Zac. In a quiet neighborhood far from the cities of
        Zaun, the scientists raised Zac as their own child.


        Zac was always different from the other children. None had his powers of strength
        and flexibility, so the couple taught him to tell right from wrong and to
        use his gifts responsibly.  Thanks to the care and affection of his loving
        parents, Zac lived a peaceful, happy childhood.


        That childhood ended when the Zaun laboratory finally found Zac. Unable to
        replicate the formula used to create the amorphous prototype, the laboratory''s
        staff never stopped searching for the scientists and their experiment. When
        they tracked down the family, they threatened to tear it apart. The staff
        abducted Zac''s parents and demanded that the couple assist in his capture
        and return. Seized by the fear of losing his freedom and his parents, Zac
        unleashed every ounce of his raw energy and mass for the very first time.
        He subdued his parents'' captors, sent the laboratory''s workers fleeing,
        and brought his loved ones home. From then on, Zac vowed to defend all ordinary
        lives threatened by extraordinary treachery and wickedness. Originally built
        to destroy, he now protects the innocent and the helpless.', quote: 'Even

    lore: {desc: 'Zed is the first ninja in 200 years to unlock the ancient, forbidden
        ways. He defied his clan and master, casting off the balance and discipline
        that had shackled him all his life. Zed now offers power to those who embrace
        knowledge of the shadows, and slays those who cling to ignorance.


        An orphan, Zed was taken in and trained by a great ninja master. Only one
        other student appeared to be Zed''s equal - the master''s son, Shen. It seemed
        Zed could never win the favor of the master, as every match between the rivals
        ended in a draw. Frustrated and jealous, he sought an advantage. The young
        ninja ventured into a sealed part of the clan''s temple, where he found an
        ornate, foreboding box. Sensing the dark knowledge within, Zed knew he should
        not open it, but he peered inside nonetheless. In an instant, shadows touched
        his mind, revealing techniques that had long been hidden. Now armed with a
        secret edge, he challenged Shen, and this time he defeated the master''s son.
        He expected praise and recognition in his moment of victory, but somehow the
        master knew Zed had used forbidden ways, and banished him.


        Humiliated, the young ninja wandered for years. His bitterness turned to ambition,
        and he began to train others in the style of the shadows. As his power grew,
        so did his circle of followers, but he knew that without the box, his technique
        would never be perfect. One day, Zed looked at his followers and saw that
        his students were now an army. He led them back to the temple to claim his
        prize. At the gates, he was surprised to find the old master waiting, receiving
        Zed and his disciples as if they were welcome guests. The old man laid his
        sword at Zed''s feet, declaring that he had failed Zed as his master. By banishing
        his former student, the master had doomed Zed to the shadows, instead of leading
        him to the balanced path. The old man implored Zed to enter the temple, destroy
        the box, and lead his followers to balance. The dark ninja followed the master
        inside. Moments later, the assembled ninjas heard Zed cry out in pain. Mysteriously,
        he emerged unscathed, and threw the severed head of the master at Shen''s
        feet. Screaming in rage, Zed commanded his followers to slaughter the master''s
        students and seize the box.


        That day, the old ninja order fell. Though many students died, some escaped
        thanks to Shen''s heroic efforts. Now the temple is a dark training ground
        for the Order of the Shadow. Zed rules as the Order''s master, and his edict
        is simple: perfect one''s technique, and kill all ninjas who refuse to embrace
        the shadows.', quote: Balance is a lie - we are the true ninjas., quote_author: Zed}

    lore: {desc: 'To Vi, every problem is just another brick wall to punch through
        with her gigantic hextech gauntlets. Though she grew up on the wrong side
        of the law, Vi now uses her criminal know-how to serve Piltover''s police
        force. Vi''s brash attitude, abrasive humor, and blatant refusal to follow
        orders can often infuriate her by-the-books partner, Caitlyn. But even the
        sheriff of Piltover cannot deny that Vi is an invaluable asset in the fight
        against crime.


        As a child growing up in the lawless outskirts of Piltover, Vi learned to
        rob and cheat to get by. Stealing and stripping hextech hardware gave her
        the skills of a master mechanic, while life on the streets taught her self-reliance.
        When she was six, a ragtag group of criminals took a shine to the young delinquent
        and brought her into their fold. By the time Vi was eleven, she had become
        a seasoned accomplice, and she relished the thrill of every heist.


        Vi''s attitude changed when a raid on a mining facility went bad. She was
        forced to decide between fleeing with her crew and trying to save the innocent
        mine workers from a collapsed tunnel. Vi chose to play the hero. While searching
        for a way to free the mine workers from the rubble, she discovered a damaged
        robotic mining rig. Improvising, she wrenched off its huge fists and modified
        them into makeshift hextech gauntlets. Fitting the heavy weapons to her tiny
        hands, the young girl flexed her arm and threw a powered punch at the rubble.
        The force of the blow blasted away the rock. With the workers free to escape,
        Vi fled the scene.


        After that job gone wrong, Vi severed her connection to the crew. She returned
        to a life of solitary crime, but stole only from other criminals. As the years
        went by, Vi modified and improved her hextech fists, allowing her to bust
        up heists and snatch loot with ease. Eventually, word of her notoriety reached
        Caitlyn, the famed Sheriff of Piltover. Rather than seek Vi''s arrest, Caitlyn
        offered the criminal a way to pay her debt to society: work for the law in
        Piltover. Vi laughed. To her, a job that let her beat up crooks without forcing
        her to run from the cops sounded perfect. She immediately accepted. Caitlyn
        now struggles to keep Vi in line, and Vi treats Caitlyn''s orders as mere
        suggestions, but when they work together, they are feared by all lawbreakers
        in Piltover.', quote: 'It''s a shame. I''ve got two fists, but you''ve only

    lore: {desc: 'Nami channels the primal energies of the ocean, harnessing its mystical
        restorative properties and commanding the raw power of the tides themselves.
        Though many doubted her, Nami had the bravery and determination to take on
        a dangerous quest when no one else would. Now her people believe she is the
        Tidecaller, a chosen one destined to complete a quest essential to the survival
        of her entire race.


        The Tidecaller''s sacred duty is to acquire a moonstone, a powerful object
        found only in the towering reaches of the surface world. Her people, the Marai,
        rely on the moonstone''s light to ward off the terrors of the depths. However,
        the stone''s power lasts only one hundred years. Before its light fades, the
        Tidecaller must journey into the Great Deep, retrieve an abyssal pearl, and
        carry it to the surface. There, on the night of the winter solstice of the
        hundredth year, the Tidecaller makes a ceremonial exchange with a landwalker
        bearing a moonstone. By trading the pearl for the moonstone, the Tidecaller
        ensures the survival of the Marai for another century.


        However, in Nami''s time, as the hundred years drew to a close, no Tidecaller
        had been found. Without a chosen one to complete the quest, her people would
        face disaster, but the Marai waited in faith that the Tidecaller would appear.
        Nami refused to sit idle, insisting that without a Tidecaller to save them,
        someone had to act. Bravely, she decided to begin the quest herself and ventured
        alone into the dangerous depths. None expected her to survive, but after six
        days of battles with untold horrors, Nami returned with the pearl in hand.
        The Marai hailed her as the new Tidecaller. All that remained was for Nami
        to journey to the surface and complete the exchange.


        When Nami arrived at the surface, however, she found only an empty shore.
        She waited for days in a mystic cove, unsure of what to do. In all the legends
        of the Tidecallers, the bearer of the moonstone had never failed to arrive.
        Nami faced a choice. She knew the surface world only through tale and rumor,
        but the survival of the Marai depended upon her. Summoning the tide to bear
        her ashore, Nami began her search for the moonstone and became the first of
        her kind to explore the world above the ocean. She left her home behind, and
        vowed not to return until she had completed the Tidecaller''s quest.', quote: 'I

    internal_name: Thresh
    lore: {desc: 'Thresh is a twisted reaper whose hungry chains ensnare the souls
        of the living. A moment''s hesitation at the sight of his ghostly visage and
        there is no escape. He leaves in his wake hollow corpses, their souls ripped
        loose and trapped in the sickly green light of his lantern. The Chain Warden
        takes sadistic joy in tormenting his victims, both before and after their
        deaths. His grim task is never complete, and he stalks the land for ever more
        resolute spirits to unravel.


        Thresh carves careful, deliberate paths through Valoran. He handpicks his
        targets individually, devoting his full attention to each soul in turn. He
        isolates and toys with them, gradually eroding their sanity with his twisted,
        maddening humor. Once Thresh takes an interest in a soul, he does not relent
        until he possesses it. He then drags those he captures back to the Shadow
        Isles for an unimaginably dreadful fate. This is his only purpose.


        Little is known about the Chain Warden''s past, and many of the details live
        only in nursery rhymes and campfire tales. They tell of a sadistic jailer
        from centuries past who took great delight in torturing his wards. Patient
        and brutal, he used a variety of methods to break his victims'' minds before
        their bodies succumbed to his grisly designs. Chains were the jailer''s preferred
        instruments of terror. Their shrill scrape marked his dreadful approach and
        promised agony to those he visited. His dark reign went unchallenged until
        his prisoners escaped during a massive riot. They overwhelmed him, and without
        ceremony or remorse, hanged him from his own chains. Thus began the unlife
        of the horrible specter known as Thresh, or so the tales go.


        Thresh now haunts the land, leaving an aftermath of horror and despair. However,
        there is a devious purpose behind his dark machinations, and the meager spirits
        of average men are insufficient. He seeks stronger souls. Only when he has
        broken the wills of Valoran''s most resilient warriors will he finally have
        what he needs.', quote: 'There are few things as invigorating as taking a
        mind apart, piece by piece.', quote_author: Thresh}

    tips:
      against: [Thresh's Death Sentence has a long cast time.  Watch for the cast
          to begin to take evasive actions., Intentionally breaking a wall of The
          Box can allow a vulnerable ally to escape unscathed., Standing on top of
          Thresh's lantern will deny his allies the ability to use it.]
      as: [Communication is key when making use of Thresh's lantern.  Let your teammates
          know how you like to use it., Death Sentence and Flay can be combined in
          either cast order for powerful combinations., Thresh can collect souls without
          needing to kill units himself.  Planning your map position to be near the
          most deaths will help to maximize soul collection.]
